~
0 IMPALE~

When you wield a polearm, you can use the impale skill to land a
devastating blow onto your opponent.
~

0 IMMRULES~

This is the list of things we have come up with to set guidelines
for the immortal staff so we don't go overboard on things.

-Equipment below the belt dosn't have any type of apb whatsoever
on it. That will be for the belt up.

-No 2 apb items, this includes weapons, auras, etc.

-Plus HP items must be limited to 5 hitpoints, which is very good.
If it has 10, it is super elite and only has one in the game. So
+5 is really really good, +10 is the best in the game nothing else
can beat it.

-AC on items need to remain fairly low. No 10/10/10/10 ac on items.
A 0/3/5/0 would be an elite item. Nothing more then 10 AC total on
an item.

-No more then 5 movements on an item.

-No +stat items unless all immortals agree on them.

-No more then 4 hit roll on an item.

-6d3 for slashes is the HIGHEST and is going to be EXTREMELY rare. 9d2 
for daggers is EXTREMELY rare. This is the best 
in the game. A 5d3 will be the very good weapons (or a dice equal to 15). 

-No race changes, alignment changes, or equipment handouts. This includes
tokens in quests, there are no more race change, warpoint, or level tokens
in quests.

-Quests will be limited to once a month and there will be no extremely
elite items unless all immortals agree and are involved in the quest.

-We need to stay out of alignment affairs. So if they ask
how the splitting order is going to be, don't answer it.
We are not mediators we are upkeep of the mud to make
sure it runs smooth. No more immortal interfence unless
its a bug or mud wide problem.

-If there is a new player, Immortals are obligated to speak to that
new mortal and explain the game to them. 

-If we build clanhouses, they are to remain extremely close to homelands
and not anywhere near central areas or high load areas. Bottom line,
they are to stay in homelands.

-Good equipment should be fairly far away from both homelands, good
experience areas should be far away from homelands, more centralized
to focal more on good PK.

-No reimbursements period. Unless it was the fault of the immortal.

-No high damage spell should do more then 400-450. Level 25 spells
should DECIMATE/OBLITERATE MAX. Level 35 spells Annihilate. Level 45 
Spells should Dissolve, Level 55 spells Liq/Errad, level 65 spells
Vaporize, Level 75+ spells atomize. 

-Area affect spells will do considerably lower damage and will not
do anymore then a mass vaporize, a possible chance of an atomize.

MORE TO COME

~


0 AGILITY~

This spell increases your combat readiness.

~

0 'HOLY AURA'~

This spell surrounds your body with a massive aura.
~

0 'Animate Sword'~

This spell summons a small sword for your followers.
~

0 'Remove Plague'
This spell will remove the viscious plague from
whoever may carry this
~

0 'Plague Ward'
This spell will protect against the plague.
~

101 IMMORTALRULES~

1. No Race Changes
2. No reimbursments unless immortals fault, period.
3. No "free equipment"
4. No "hookups"
5. No playing mortals.
6. No cheating.
7. No back exits for clans, one entrance per clan.
8. No unseen exits unless distinctly marked in description.
9. No name changes
10. No switching characters unless consulted by another immortal.

There are way more rules to come, these are the only ones I could
think of for right now, we will abide by these rules and not budge
on any of these.
~


0 SHOOT LOAD UNLOAD~

You can now shoot enemies up to 3 rooms away. There are three classes
of bows you can use: shortbow, crossbow, and long bow, with ranges
of 1, 2, and 3 rooms, respectively. To shoot, you must first
wield a bow, and then LOAD the proper type of ammunition. Load takes
no arguments, it just searches for the first arrow of the
proper type in your inventory. You can UNLOAD a loaded weapon if
you wish, too. 

In order to shoot someone, just type "shoot <name>" and the game
automatically looks for a person with that name within range.
Then, you will be put into shooting mode and will have to wait
a second or so to aim, then you let loose with your arrow.

Arrows and bows can be forged with the forge command, and the more
powerful the material these items are made of, the harder you
hit. The power of the hit is determined by the weaker of the two
materials, so you cannot just use a weak bow with strong arrows
or a weak arrow with a strong bow and expect to get much damage.
The high end damage is really high, but it is also hard to
keep forging these items over and over.

Arrows disappear after they are used, whether they hit the target, or not.


~
0 Tier Tiers~

Tiers are available within the major guilds of all Classes.  By
tiering you raise your character's status amoung your class and
are entitled to specialized guild equipment.  There are currently
four tiers for your character to advance through.  In order to
obtain a tier simply say "tier me".  To advance in a tier you 
also say "tier me", if you do not have the requirements to tier
you will not be allowed to tier and will be informed so.  Upon
tiering you will recieve a free set of the tier equipment. There
is no warpoint loss for tiering.

Tier 1 -  100 warpoints
Tier 2 -  350 warpoints
Tier 3 -  750 warpoints
Tier 4 - 1500 warpoints

If you are found with Tier items that you did not earn you will be
considered a cheater and abuser of bugs, and will be dealt with per
help rules.

See help "tier equipment" for more information.

~
0 'Tier Equipment' tierequipment~

Tier equipment is a bonus for obtaining a higher status in a
guild.  This specialized equipment is not able to be looted
and will dissappear on your death.  Your first set of tier
equipment is free for each tier, afterward you will have to
purchase new tier equipment from the guildmaster. In order to
purchase new tier equipment at the guildmaster say "tier eq"
and the shop store menu will be displayed.  Follow instructions
given in this menu to purchase the items.  For items such as
earrings, auras, or symbols you will recieve a set of two items.

The following are the costs for tier equipment.

Tier 1 eq -  5 warpoints
Tier 2 eq - 10 warpoints
Tier 3 eq - 15 warpoints
Tier 4 eq - 20 warpoints

See also help tier

~
0 THROW~

You can throw a piercing weapon, or an axe. It is strongly suggested
that you throw forged weapons only, since this will give you
huge bonuses to damage. The higher end damage from throw is enormous,
but you must consider how hard it is to get the materials to keep
forging them, since thrown objects disappear when they are thrown,
whether they hit the target, or not.

~


0 CHOOSESIDES CHOOSE~

When you first enter the game you are of the neutral alignment,
the choossides command allows you to pick one of the two active
sides within the world.  To use it you must be in the room of
choosing and type choose <align>, where align is a number between
1 and 2.  To view help on each of the sides use the aligninfo
command.

~

0 'Elemental Shield'~
This spell will allow the caster protection against wounding, acid, fire,
ice, and plague.
~

0 'Obscure'~
This spell will grant the caster the power to not be located for a short
period of time.
~

0 'Detect Fog'~
This spell will allow the caster to see during extreme fog conditions.
~
0 'Shooting Stars'~
This spell will allow the caster to call upon the heavens for a
massive barrage of stars falling from above.
~


0 TRANSFORM~

The transform command is what remorts you.

transform <stat> <stat> <stat>

Stat is an abbreviated stat as in STR, CON, DEX, INT, WIS.
You may also specify NONE to forsake a stat at remort if you
max out your stats.

You gain 1 damroll per remort, and 1/2 skill, 1/2 proficiency, 1/2 
natural casting level, and 1 spell, rounded up. Your spell power 
also increases a little bit. You will also gain 1/2 hp per level
per remort over and above any consititution points you get.

Additional options to remorting are:
transform <stat> <stat> <augment>

This works exactly as above but you give up your third stat in order
to gain an augment, to view available augments type augment list, for
help on what augments are type help augment.

transform race <racenumber>
available ONLY AT or BELOW your 2nd remort, you can not transform into a
remort(ASCENDED) race, but you may transform into any other. By undergoing
a race change you give up the stats you would have gained by
remorting.  The process of converting may make you lose stats, reallocates
your stats accordingly, and may not put them where you want.

If you are unhappy with your stats an IMM will adjust your stats for you
under the following conditions. You must contact an IMM BEFORE you reach
level 11. We will move your stats for you, within racial limits. We will
not add to the total, whatever you got when you racechanged for a total
is what you will have after we move them. So be warned, you could roll 
very badly when you racechange. Don't do this unless you are VERY prepared
to delete and reroll and start over. Racechange is a HUGE crapshoot.

This option is only available when you remort for the first and second time.
~


0 REMORT REMORTING~



Remorting is a little different here. Before ascending the remort system
works almost exactly like other emlens, albeit with a few more options.
To remort you must reach level 56 and then execute the transform command.
You may execute transform before ascending from anywhere in the world.
After ascension additional requirements are needed to remort besides level.
These additional requirements come in the form of warpoints, killpoints,
and levels.

Type remort costs to see the costs. (This will not work before you ascend
as there are no costs)

There is a max of 8 remorts.

To remort, you must find the proper room for your remort...which could
require a quest or killing something powerful. Once you get there,
type remort remort and you will be transported to the actual room of
remorting.  Note the room for remorting may be different for each remort,
the amount of power necessary to remort as an ascended character is
quite phenomenal, and it increases with successive remorts.

Once in that room, you must {R}TRANSFORM{w}.
~


0 DONATE DONATION~

Donations are no longer in the game.

~

110 BANKSET SETBANK~


Syntax : setbank <good/evil/number> <amount> <warpoints/gold>

This admin command lets you set a bank by hand. Note that the first
argument will be good or evil or a number from 1-22 representing a
clan number.

~

0 BUILDER BUILDING~

We are accepting new builders at loc.inetsolve.com 3335. Do not bug the
admins on the player port for a builder. 

Building is a lot of work. Making the rooms and objects and mobiles
and descriptions is a lot of work. Please be serious about building
and understand that it takes a big committment to make an area.
Be sure you have the patience and endurance to carry a project
through. 

Please read the FAQ for general building information if you are a
new builder.

weapons. Piercing is a must skill for Thieves/Assassins.

101 FAQ~

Section One.  #1.

  Virtual numbers, or "vnums", are "landmarks" for the location of mobs,
rooms, and objects.  Type "count <myname>". If you see an area listed for
you type redit create <lower_vnum> to go to your area. If it already
exists, type go <lower_vnum> to go to your area.

If you are making several areas, please keep the objects and mobiles and
rooms separated so that in case one or more of your areas is not 
in the game, the areas that are in the game will be complete.

To edit rooms, use "redit" which is short for "room editor".
You can type "redit" alone or "redit <number>" which will trans you
to room <number> and let you edit it.

For example:
Make a room name by typing name A Dark Forest

Change the sector to forest by typing forest

Writing a desc is just like writing a note. Be sure to type .f
at the end of the desc to format it nicely.

When you want to link a room, there are three ways to do this.
To make a two-way exit between your current room and a new room,
type <dir> dig <new_room_number> This will create and link the room.

If the other room exists, type <dir> link <new_room_number>

If the other room exists and there is an exit in the opposite direction 
you are linking (i.e. you do an n link 30425 and room 30425 has a south
exit), then it will not let you link, but you can still make a
one-way exit with <dir> room <new_room_number>. Do not make
cheater one-way rooms from your area to another area, or even 
link any rooms in your area with another area. If you make a mistake then 
we can undo it, but intentionally linking different areas without
permission is cheating.

PLEASE use the vnums in your area in order starting from the first area
and going to the last. If you make a mistake on a room, you can
always unlink all the exits and redo the name and desc. 

Doors are set the following way: <dir> door    <dir> closed
<dir> name <name>. Sometimes you want to use <dir> hidden or
<dir> locked but use these sparingly. More is said about this in
help redit.

Please try to use good grammar, and please do not copy room 
descriptions more than about 5-10 rooms. I understand we have
lots of big open areas here, but it is kind of lame seeing
100 of the same room descs.


To make a mobile (monster) find the first vnum in your area
and type medit create <vnum>.

Then you will notice the top half of your screen changes.
Now type name dog small doggie
short a small dog
long A small dog is here wagging its tail at you.

Now you have made the "what you see" parts of the mob.

You can make the mob's descritption the same way as
you did for the room, by typing desc and then editing like you
would edit a note. It is suggested that mobiles have descriptions
but it is not required at this point.

type male (or female) to se the sex of the mob. 

type help act_bits...these list all of the actions the mob can take.

If you type infrared or flying or mindshield or sanctuary etc...
you set those bits. Type affectlist or affect2 to get a list of those 
things.

Set the kind of mob see help mob_types to get a list of this, but for
now type canine.
 
The mob's level should be 1-20 for easy lowlevel mobs, 20-50 for middling
mobs, 50-100 for single person exp mobs, 100-150 for exp mobs,
150+ for tough eq mobs.

You can set the hps multiplier but please leave it at 10 = 1.0x hps
unless you have a really compelling reason to change it, and even then
only change it for a few mobs in your area at most.

Now type done

Type oedit create <vnum>  the same vnum you used for the mob

Now we will make an object.

Type weapon
type name sword short
type short a short sword
type long A short sword slowly rusts on the ground.

type take
type hold
type weight 45
type cost 300
type light_slash

The following are specific to wepaons...all objects have special
obj_values which you can see by typing help obj_values.

type v1 20
type v3 3
type v7 3
type v8 3

You now made a 3d3 light_slash short sword. Weapons have an average damage
of (v7*(v8+1))/2. Never make weapons with an average damage
of more than 10. If you do not understand average damage, don't make
a weapon at all.

type done


This gives you a brief overview of the processes of making things.
See the help files on medit oedit and redit for more information.

100 Z_RELOCATE~

Alright props to Bern and Structure for figuring this crap out.
First z_relocate_rooms/mobs/obj to the designated vnums, then
Aedit the number of the old area and change them to the vnums
you just assigned. For example I have an area that is
96000-97000 and I z_relocate_mobs/rooms/obj 96000 97000 5000
5000 being the vnums i want to move the location to. Once
those 3 z_relocates are complete, aedit the area that has
96000-97000 in it and switch the vnums to 5000-6000 then
asave complete and reboot.

0 MOB_POWER~

Don't put more than one exp mob (level 100+) per 50 rooms in your
area. 

Don't put more than one midlevel mob (level 50-100) per 25 rooms
in your area.

Basic Rule: Don't make an expwhore cheater area.

110 LORE~

lore <spellname> will give you information on the ingredients necessary
to brew a particular potion. If that potion is not brewable, it will
say so. You will only see some of the ingredients each time you try to
find out some lore about the potion.

Lore will not work at all unless it is practiced fully.

0 'SLASHING WEAPONS'~

Slashing weapons improves your accuracy with sword like objects.
*NOTE* Slashing weapons is a must need for warriors.
~

0 'CONCUSSION WEAPONS'~

Concussion weapons are generally club like objects, this skill
will vastly improve your accuracy with club like objects. This
is also a very much needed skill for warrior like classes.
~

0 'WHIPPING WEAPONS'~

Whipping weapons are generally whips or flails.  Having this skill
allows the user to become more accurate with the use of the weapon.
Whipping weapons also have the chance to disarm the opponent.
~

0 'POLEARM WEAPONS'~
These weapons are generally weapons that are attached to poles. These
include halberds, spears, lances, poleaxes, and their like.  Having
this skill allows the user to effectively utilize the weapon, greatly
increasing the damage.
~

0 ENCHANT~

The enchant skill lets you put extra affects on items. Here are the rules.

You type enchant <item> <location>. The modifier is set automatically.
The item must be in your inventory, and the item must be armor or a weapon.

The possible locations you can choose from are:

dam hp move saving_throw kick_damage sneak_bonus
hide_bonus ac hit

The location must be spelled exactly as above: no abbreviations.
You must be a Necromancer to enchant.
You must have 800+ hps.
You must learn enchant all the way up as much as possible.
The item cannot be enchanted already or you get hurt. The item will 
go poof.
The item cannot have an affect of the type you are adding...
even if the first one is bad.
You must be level 60 to add stats or damroll.
Kick_damage must be added to legs, feet, knees, or ankles only.

Every enchantment has a cost in coins depending on the enchantment
type. 
If the item already has damroll affect, the cost is doubled.
If the item is not body, head, arm, leg, or foot armor, the cost is doubled.
You need to have the money in the bank to enchant, but for now, you can
enchant from anywhere.

You must make a certain roll vs your enchantment skill.
If you fail, the item may be destroyed.

{R}IF YOU MAKE IT TO THE END OF THE ENCHANTMENT AND SUCCESSFULLY
ENCHANT THE ITEM YOU WILL LOSE ONE HIT POINT PERMANENTLY!!!!!{w}

The costs for enchantments range from 150k coins (not gold) for 
dam to 10k for hitroll or ac or saving throw (then multiplied as above). 

~


110 BREW~

This does nothing yet. But, it will allow you to create potions which contain
spells and potions which can be used to enchant or prepare other things
to be made. The use of this skill will require a mortar and pestle which
can be forged by use of the forge command.

You hold the pestle, you have the mortar in your inventory with the
required herbs in it. You then type brew <spellname> <spellname>
<spellname> where some of the spellnames are possibly blank. Then,
if the mortar and pestle are powerful enough, and if you have
all of the ingredients in there for brewing you will attempt to
brew a potion. If you fail (due to skill check) you will lose some
of the ingredients. The mortar disappears if you successfully brew
a potion. But, mortars are only one chunk to forge.

Brew will not work at all unless it is practiced fully.

0 FORGE MINERAL MINERALS~

There are 15 kinds of metals, which you can use to forge.

You can forge anvils, hammers, breastplates, shields, helmets, sleeves, 
gauntlets, belts, pants, boots, rings, earrings, masks, bracelets, 
and anklets, kneepads, elbowpads, shortbows, arrows (to go with
shortbows), crossbows, bolts (to go with crossbows), longbows, and shafts 
(to go with longbows).

You can also forge daggers, swords, clubs, halberds and flails. 

In order to do this, you must have a certain number of "chunks" of the
appropriate mineral type. This number can range from 1 to about 30.
You must be in a room where there is a forge. There must be an anvil in the
room of a mineral type >= the type you want to forge, and you must be
holding a forging hammer of a type >= the type you want to forge.
You must drop the appropriate number of the proper mineral in the room. 
Then type forge <mineral> <item> and if all is well (meaning you have
all the required stuff and you are a tinker skilled at forging), you should
get an item created.

There are two cases where you can forge items greater than the hammer
and anvil you have. If you have a hammer and anvil of a certain type,
you can forge a hammer of the next type up.
If you have a hammer of a type, and an anvil of one less power, you can
forge an anvil of the same type as the hammer. This is necessary
since the only items that will pop are brass anvils and hammers. The
rest of them you gotta find the materials to make. Be warned,
anvils and hammers are MUCH more expensive than armors of the same
type.


Whenever an anvil is used to forge a new anvil, the old one disappears.
Whenever a hammer is used to forge a new hammer, the old hammer
disappears.

Order of the minerals for forging is as follows:

Copper, Tin, Aluminum, Iron, Steel, Electrum, Silver, Gold, Platinum,
Molybdenum, Nickel, Titanium, Mithril, Orichalicum, Adamantium.

0 OBJ_POWER~

For every 25 rooms you make, you may have one pop of one armor item which
has up to +5 hp XOR +5 moves XOR +1 hitroll XOR -1 ac apply XOR -1
spellsave. These armor items will have ac 1-3 TOTAL!! unless they are
shields in which case total armor can be up to 6. These items pop at
<=20 percent on level 50+ mobs. (It is possible to make +1kickdam
LEGWEAR or FOOTWEAR at this level too!!)

For every 50 rooms you make...
You may also put in a pop of a standard (or one of your own) weapons
which has average damage of at most 8. If you make your own item,
you may NOT put ANY affects on this item. These items pop at
<= 20 percent on level 50+ mobs.


For every 100 rooms you make you may put in an armor item which is up
to +1apb XOR +1stat XOR +10hp XOR +10moves XOR +2hitroll XOR -2 ac
XOR -2 spellsave XOR +1kickdam. These armor items will have ac 4-6,
except shields which can be up to ac 10. These items pop at <= 1pct
on level 130+mobs. (The exception to this is kickdam boots and
legwear which can have 2-3 kickdam at this point.)

For every 100 rooms you make, You may put in a weapon which is ave
9-10 (including 3d6). These weapons will pop at <=5 percent on level 
80+ mobs. These weapons can have 1-2 hitroll and 0-1 damroll...
but do **********NOT********** put ANY other affects on these weapons.

For every 100 rooms you make, you may pop a weak gem (below level
40) on a mob which is level 70-130 at 10-3 percent depending on
the power of the gem. If you don't know which gems are more or less
powerful, wtf are you doing trying to pass yourself off as a builder.
The chips can be at 10 pct and the low level rainbows should be at
3 pct or so. DON'T MAKE NEW GEMS.

You will NEVER EVER EVER make ANY weapon above ave 10 for any reason
in your area. I dont care if its on a level 10000 mob behind a level
2000 mob with a .1 pct key behind a .1 pct portal in an area where
the mobs are all aggro and you couldnt POSSIBLY POSSIBLY ever ever
get to it. Never make weapons that powerful even for testing purposes.

For every 400 rooms you make, your special per 100 room armor item
can have (1 apb  XOR 1 stat XOR ((3-4 for legs/feet) or (1 for other) 
kickdam))  AND up to (10 hp XOR +2hitroll XOR 10 moves XOR -2 ac apply
XOR -2 spellsave). These pop at <= .3pct on level 150+ mobs.

Also for every 400 rooms you make, you may put in a pop of a LARGE gem
at <=.3 pct on level 150+ mobs.

Dont make potions or scrolls or pills or wands or staves ..those are for
twinks. Also..no spells in fountains..even if its "just for your builder".
You do it, you go poof.


Also...don't just make a bigass area with 800 rooms and put in 2
elite items. We expect you to "fill in " with all the lower powered
crap items that you are allowed before you put in the better stuff.
Also, don't use minuses to try to get around the rules on how
often things can pop or how much the addaffects can be.
In particular, don't ever make +2 apb or +2stat or +1stat +1apb
items. There is no excuse for doing that.

101 REDIT~

There are several main components to building a room.
First you type redit create <number> or <dir> dig <number> to make a new room.
That will put you in the new room.

Then you set the room name, sector type, other exits, and room desc.
There are also room flags, but all of these things are explained in more 
detail in the help files that follow.

It is helpful to make aliases like

e.g.,   alias nn n dig
	alias ss s dig
	alias uu u dig 

and so forth. It makes getting the rooms down much easier.  Also, at this
point make alias aa asave changed.  Be sure to type aa every once in a
while, and when you leave. If not, and the game crashes, then you lose all
your work that you have done since the last asave changed.

There are also two commands which let you (sort of) see what your area
will look like. They are drawtop and code. Be sure to check those out. The
way to get out of drawtop is cls (clearscreen).  Be sure when creating a
room that you set the name, sector type, and any flags you would like to
see there. Each of the things you can set for doors (exits ) is listed in
the following chart: 

If you are scripting and want the room to trigger a script when something
enters or leaves you MUST type enterscript or leavescript resp or else
the program will not check this when people enter the room. If you want
the room to trigger a script when a certain command is typed, you must type 
commandscript to set that up too.


The following commands are available from within the REDITOR:

show                - hitting return, or 'show' shows the room stats
done                - exists the room editor and returns to normal play
create <vnum>       - creates a room with a certain vnum
name <room title>   - changes the room title
ed add <keyword>    - type this command for additonal extra-description
copyto <room vnum>  - Copies the room descript to <room vnum>
desc                - edit description of room

See Also: {R}ROOM_FLAGS{w}

For exits, type the direction (north/s/e/w) followed by:
delete              - delete this exit
link <room vnum>    - make a two way link
room <room vnum>    - make a one way link (use with caution)
key <object vnum>   - makes specified object the vnum of the key required
name <door name>    - makes the door's name/keywords = to the given name
hidden              - must have name <keyword> set.. makes it so you have 
		      to search to find the keyword.
desc                - edit the description of the exit

door                - makes exit a door
closed              - defaults exit to closed
locked              - defaults exit to locked
eat_key             - makes exit eat keys after being unlocked
pickproof           - lockpicks/pick command dont work on this door
hp                  - Sets a door's max hp before breaking open
str                 - How resistent to breakage and if it's destroyed
		      completely.  If < 0, the door is broken perm.
		      If you want broken doors to reset, type fixdoor
		      to set the door to reset no matter what.
transport           - makes the room automove all chars in direction.
see: help transport   Must have room and exit in that direction first.

Ex:      east delete
	 east link 3034
	 east name a small red door

0 FIX PATCH~

This skill lets you repair equipment up to a certain point.
~

0 MINE~

This skill lets you look for metals. You must be holding a pickaxe
and must be in the proper kind of room and you must know the mine skill.
Once a room has been cleared of minerals, no more will appear there until
the next reboot. Once a player has mined too much, they will have
to wait for the next reboot to mine more.

*DO NOT* put in the cheatermana flag if you know what it is. If someone
asks you what it is you are not supposed to put in, don't tell them. 


There are also TRAPS which you may put into a room. Basicaly these are
things which deal out damage to anyone in the room at random intervals. 


 firetrap       Flames rise up, doing 1-35 damage every 1-3 seconds
		Intelligence and dexterity can allow you to dodge the 
		flames to an extent.
 rocktrap       Falling rocks fall at random times (1-7 seconds) on a 
		victim's head.  His helmet can absorb the blows to an
		extent.  Without helmet it does 1-50 damage OUCH!  
		Also, the victim's helmet will be damaged if it is metal    
		(ie has a higher armor class).  Note: high dexterity and 
		intelligence and wisdom may allow you to dodge the rocks.
 arrowtrap      This makes arrows shoot "out of nowhere" to hit the victim.
		Arrows are dodgeable and victim's armor makes a difference.
		Dodge depents on intelligence and dexterity. 1-30 dam
 poisontrap     Exactly like above but if hit, you will be poisoned for 
		1-10 hours.  If poisoned, it will add 1 hour for each time
		you get hit.
 gastrapone     This can be used for swamps and sewers.  Does 1-4 damage 
		ocassionally and cannot be dodged or saved against.
 gastraptwo     A much meaner version of gastrapone.  It does 1-35 damage 
		and poisons the victim.  If victim is poisoned, it adds 
		1 hour to duration.
 spiketrap      Players sometimes fall on spikes and get damaged (spikes 
		should be in the room description to use this trap!
 avalanche      NOTE: An avalance only goes off once!  It does enormous
		damage, and therefore it is recommended that an avalanche 
		room be set to no_mobs, so wandering mobs don't trigger it.
 manadrain      This room drains mana when you stand in it (the gem 
		the victim is holding).       
 gysertrap      This will make it so a spray of scalding hot water hits
		its victim, doing a good amount of damage.  Make sure
		you put in your room description about something that
		could do such a thing, like a gyser.  Otherwise this trap
		won't make much sense.

101 OEDIT~

Oedit is the command that lets you create and edit items. To try this
out, pick a vnum from your area and type oedit create <vnum>. This will
basically show you a blank template of an item you can use to build on.
There are several things you need to do to set the item up.

You need a name, eg. type name long sword

You need a short desc (what you see in eq and inventory) eg. short a long sword

You need a long desc (what you see in the room) eg. A rusty old long sword is here.

You now need to pick what kind of an object you have eg. weapon, armor food...
See help obj-types for a list of all the object types. Some you should not
use, and those are listed.

An object also needs an object type, see OBJ-VALUES, where the object
types are the words on the left side. Just type the word by itself like
weapon or potion. 

Then you should set the object take/wear flags. See: WEAR_BITS.  

Then set any extra flags that the item needs. See: EXTRA-FLAGS.
In general, do not set anti align flags on items.

Set the weight and cost of the item weight <weight> cost <cost>.
Weights should be as follows. Weights now are basically 10x as big as before.
So swords should weigh 80 if you were thinking in terms of a weight of 8 as 
before. Be careful setting armor and weapon costs. Really good stuff 
should not cost over 20000. 


Finally set the value flags. See help OBJ_VALUES. Each item has specific 
item values which it needs set. 

If you are scripting and want this object to have a drop or give script, 
you must type dropscript or givescript or the game will not look through 
the triggers when it is dropped or given. If you wish for an object to
 start a script when a command is given, you must type commandscript for 
this to happen.


Then you should be done.


show                - hitting return, or 'show' shows the object stats
done                - exits the object editor and returns to normal play
timer <# of ticks>  - sets the timed age of an object (automated self-destruct)
name <keywords>     - sets the keywords on an object
short <desc>        - sets the 'name' of an object (a sword, a fish etc)
long                - edit long description (the one in the room)
value0 <num> (or v0)- sets the value '0' on the object (also abbrev.d to 'v0')
value1 <num>        - sets the value '1' on the object (also abbrev.d to 'v1')
value2 <num>        - sets the value '2' on the object (also abbrev.d to 'v2')
value4 <num> etc...
weight <kg>         - sets the weight of the object
cost <coins>        - sets the gold value of the object
create <vnum>       - creates object with specified vnum
ed add <keyword>    - type this for adding/editing extended descriptions
addaffect           - type this for info on adding object affects/applies
remaffect           - removes an affect on an object
You may also type the name of the object type (see IREF OBJ-TYPES) or
you can type the name of the extra bit you want to toggle (IREF EXTRA-FLAGS).
You can also type the name of an affect (see AFFECT-BITS), but do __NOT__
use these without asking a god first.

101 SHOPKEEPER SHOPKEEPERS~

To make a mob a shopkeeper, you must first edit the mob in question.
There is no shop create command, just type in the shop hours below
and that automatically creates the shop.

Shop hours <opening> <closing>

The first order of business is to set the hours of the shop. The
numbers you choose should be between 0 and 24, and these represent the
hours the shop is open: for example if the numbers were 3 and 20, then
the shop would be open from 3am to 8pm every day.

Shop Profit <number1> <number2>

Then you must set the shop profit. Shop profit <number1> <number2>.
Number1 is the percent of the cost of the item that you must pay when
you buy items from the shop. Number2 is the percent of the item's cost
you get when you sell items to the shop. Shop profit number1 should
always be 100, and number2 should be around 50. This way you can buy
things from the shop, and sell them back at half price. And yes, if
this is messed up, it is possible to make "cheater shops", but we
would really not appreciate that.

Shop Decrease <percent>

This sets the decrease in the percentage you get from selling items to
the shop, once too many of that item have been sold.

Shop Items <number>

This sets the number of items which must be sold back to the shop of a
certain type, before the shop starts paying less for that item.

Shop Type <num> <type>

You may make a shop sell and buy up to 5 different types of items.
To make the shop sell gems and scrolls and potions type the following:

shop type 1 gem
shop type 2 scroll
shop type 3 potion

and so forth.

Shop Creates <vnum>

If a shop creates new items during the game (like bakers baking
bread), then set this to the vnum you want...eg vnum 37. The shop
should only do this in the case of food or other worthless items.

Shop creates_hours <number>

This tells how often the shop makes a new item: once per <number>
hours.

Shop message

This gives a message when the new item is created..

eg: shop message Shelara the baker brings a piping hot loaf of bread out of the oven.

Shop delete

If you don't want this mob to be a shopkeeper anymore, use this command.


~


101 MAGEMOB~
To create a spell casting mobile, enter the mobile editor and type
cast_p <% to cast all spells>
then type
casts <exact spell name>

For example to make a mob #1221 cast Tornado of Souls and Fireball at 20%
you would:

medit 1221
cast_p 20
casts Tornado of Souls
casts Fireball
done

These must be set by admins to keep things from getting out of control. 
In general the percents will be 5-10 percent of the mob casting the spell, 
and the level of the mob should be at least double the spell level which it 
will cast.

See Also: {R}SLIST{w} to see which spells mobs can be made to cast.

          prot_gas:   This affect flag makes the mob resistant to gas.
        mindshield:   This protects you from some affects of bad magic.
             speed:   This can give you an extra attack occasionally.
          paralyze:   This paralyzes someone.
        prot_shock:   This affect flag makes the mob more resistant to shock.
         prot_wind:   This affect flag makes the mob more resistant to wind.
        prot_wound:   This affect flag makes the mob more resistant to wound.
     prot_paralyze:   This affect flag makes the mob more resistant to paral.
       prot_locate:   This affect flag makes the mob more resistant to locate.
          prot_ice:   This affect flag makes the mob more resistant to ice.
         prot_acid:   This affect flag makes the mob more resistant to acid.
        fireshield:   This causes a wall of fire to engulf you and damage attackers.

107 SCRIPT SCRIPTS SCRIPTING~

Scripts have two main components. 

1. A trigger associated with a mob, object or room which starts
the script, and

2. Some code which is called by the trigger.

To make a trigger see help SCRIPTEDIT.

To make some script code, see help SCRIPT2.
To work on editing triggers see help SCRIPTEDIT
When you make triggers and code and flags please use names
associated with your builder names to keep thing from getting
confused. Like if you are named Freddy, use trigger names
like fred01, fred02 etc...and code like fred01, fred02...
and scriptflags like fred01, fred01...etc.

LISTTRIGGERS lists all of the triggers.

LISTCODE lists all of the code chunks.

~

107 SCRIPT2~

To edit a code chunk, use EDIT CREATE <name>, or EDIT <name>.
Code chunk names can only be up to 10 letters long.

To type in your code, precede all lines with a :1, :2, :3, etc... as line
numbers.  You may insert something before line two just by typing :2 stuff to
insert.  To clear a line, type .c <ln>.  If you forgot some line numbers,
type .f to format it and make it look pretty.


Inside the code:
Code is basically interpretted by what is calling it "as is".  There are
some special functions though:

@P              Substitute the person who triggered the script's name here
@M              Substitute the mob who is running the script's name here
@O              Substitute the object who is running the script's short desc
@V              Substitues the vnum (object if obj, room if room, mob if mob)
@R(min,max)     Random number between min and max.
@DA<number>     Returns 1 if the person who set off the script has a diff
                alignment from the number given. Good for gateguards and
                protector mobs.


'@Cc' Clan Number
'@Ch' Char current hps
'@Ck' Char's Killpoints
'@Cl' Char's Level
'@Cm' Char current moves
'@Cr' Char's remorts
'@Ct' Mud time in hours, 14 for 2, 24 for 12 etc
'@Cw' Char remorts
 
eg: if @Cl>=10 then (read as: if level >= 10 then)

Note that you need to have no spaces in these conditionals,
if @Cl >=10         does nothing.

GOTO <ln>       jumps to a line number in that code chunk
CALL <label>    jumps to another code chunk/label
RECHO           echos something to the room.
WAIT <x> <type> where <x> is the number of ticks.  <type> is one of these:
		superquick : fastest pulse, about 3 per second
		quick      : a tick is about 1 second with quick
		heart      : a tick is the length of a heartbeat (regen)
		hour       : the wait is a full game hour
DONE            ends the script here and then, wherever it is encountered
CREATE_MOB <v>  where <v> is the vnum of the mob to create.
CREATE_OBJ <v>  where <v> is the vnum of the obj to create.
DESTROY_OBJ <v> where <v> is the vnum of the obj to destroy.
DESTROY_OBJ     with no arguments, if it's an object script, destroys the
		object upon which the script is running and ends script.

IF              This is a powerful command, but you must know how to work it.
		You may compare two numbers using ==, >=, <=, >, <, or !=

		You may compare two strings using == and !=

		You can do things such as: IF @R(1,3)==2 then

IF (flag)       This checks if the given flag is set on the character
IF (!flag)      This chekcs if the given flag is NOT set on the character
PSET @P         This allows mobs to pset players. Useful for 
                scriptflags and such. If you ever make a script that
                has a nonscript flag pset in it...for any reason..even if
                this would allow you to cure cancer, create world peace,
                end hunger and let humans colonize space...you will be 
                deleted and your areas will be removed. Do not pset
                players unless it is a scriptflag as in 
                pset @P scriptflag <flagname> on/off

IF is followed by a " then", and nothing else on the line.
If the statement is TRUE, then the NEXT LINE, and the NEXT LINE ONLY! get
executed.  This is in the style of assembly language.  You CANNOT use {} like
in C.  This makes GOTO and CALL very important.

examples:

:1 if @R(1,3)!=2 then
:2 call not_two
:3 say the number was equal to 2!

..or..

:1 if (!OR2) then
:2 goto 5
:3 say You have the orin 2 flag on, btw.
:4 done
:5 say You don't have the or2 flag on!! setting it to on!
:6 pset @P scriptflag OR2 on

..or..

:1 if @P==Orin then
:2 echo Orin is in the house everybody!!
:3 done
---------------
Useful flags!!!
---------------
Note: Objects and rooms may only set things, etc.. they cannot "say" "tell",
etc... they can, however RECHO.

Flags are up to four letters long and are stored on the character.  To set
a flag, your script (or you can do it manually) should use:

pset playername scriptflag <sf> ON/OFF

Here are some examples:
pset @P scriptflag SF1 ON
pset @P scriptflag AAA OFF

Please note... 'clean up' script flags in scripts.. if you have temporary
script flags, make sure to have the flags cleared when the script is
complete, and make it so only a single "script complete" scriptflag is on.
There can be up to 3000 script flags stored on a character.  However, it
doesn't keep track... if you remove a script from the game, characters will
retain the 3 or 4 letter script flag identifiers on them.
Script flags can't overlap.. make sure to come up with some scheme.. for
insance god PALIO might use PA1 - PA99, and ORIN might use OR1 - OR99.

0 SCRIPTEDIT TRIGGERS TRIGGER~

Format: scriptedit create <trigger_id> or scriptedit <trigger_id>

Each trigger has a unique ID which can be up to 20 letters in length.
Once in the trigger editor, press enter to see current info on the
current "script"/"trigger".


{R}A lot of the triggers require some flag to be set on the mob/obj/room
which is doing the triggering. The words are listed to the right...
so you go into redit/medit/oedit and type commandscript or
4leavescript or whatever is required for the type of trigger and
the type of triggering thing.{w}


The current triggers CURRENTLY available are:

EVERY_REGENTICK Every 5-6 seconds       M
GIVEN           When given object       OM  need to set givescript on the object
                                            need to set 4givescript on the mob

MOVES           When the mob moves      M     need to set 4movescript on mob

Keywords hold extra data.. for instance, the keywords:
'hello there' 'hello' 'greeting' 'hi'
would be used in conjunction with a SAY trigger to go off when a player
uses one of those expressions in his/her SAY command.  A blank keyword with
a say/tell field will trigger always when a player says/tells.


with given/dropped, keywords can hold a list of vnums to trigger on.
If blank, any vnum will do.  EG: if it's a mob script, keywords holds a list
of vnums the script will trigger on if the mob is given object vnum X.
If it's a object script, keywords holds a list of vnums of mobs the script
will trigger on if the obj is given to this mob.

Coming in the future: (possibly) GIVEN_MONEY, ON_DEATH, OBJ_SACCED

Other options in scriptedit:
----------------------------

CODE <code_chunk>       This is the code chunk which is "launched" when
			your trigger goes off.
interrupt               this toggles whether or not the script can be
			interrupted part way through with another trigger
			instance. (Not usually good if the script "lingers"
stops                   In specific scripts (room/mob), if this is set
			and the character leaves the room, the script ends.
player                  Player only.  If this is on, only players will be
			able to trigger the script.  If not, mobs entering

			the room and such can trigger it.
Room <vnum>
Mob <vnum>              These are the vnums the script is linked onto. 
Obj <vnum>              Only ONE of these should be set!!

101 RESET1~
This help file will (hopefully) explain you how to make mobs and objects
reset by themselves.  This is usually done after the area is done, but when
you do it is up to you.

Resets are done by number.  This means, if there are 4 total resets in a 
room, they will be numbered 1-4.  Also note that both objects and mobiles
are room-resets.  RESET with no argument will show you the current resets
for the room you are in.  RESET 1 will show you the basic syntax for using
the RESET command, but that is confusing, and the reason this help file 
exists.

The first type of reset (although maybe not in the RESET 1 display) is a
mob reset.  This type of reset will let you automatically load a mob into
the room. 

The syntax is: RESET <number> MOB <vnum> [<chance> <max number>].

Let's take it one at a time.  <number> is the number of the reset, not
how many to load.  This will be more discussed later, and you can usually
just make it 1.  MOB isn't a variable, just put MOB to tell that it is a
mob reset.  <vnum> is the vnum of the mob you want loaded.  <chance> is
the % chance that the mob will load upon reset.  <max number> is how many
of the mob can exist in the world; for example, shopkeepers would be 1, 
so that two identical 'Bob''s don't load in the room.  <chance> and 
<max number> are in [ ]'s which mean they are OPTIONAL(you can leave them
out and it will assume 75% chance, and 100 max number.)

For example, let's say you have a small red bat, vnum 10000.  You would type
RESET 1 MOB 10000 100 7 - if you want it to always load, and 7 max in 
world.

If you want mobs to automatically mount, just set the mounting mob's
riding act3 flag, and put it in the reset list after the mob you want 
it to mount.

Same goes for follower mobs.

See Also: {R}RESET2, RESET{w}

~

101 'IREF RESET2' RESET2~
The second type of reset is an object reset.  These are more complicated
than mobs, but the syntax is similar. 

The syntax is: RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> NONE [chance].

<number>, like mob resets, is the number of the reset, not how many to
load.  For now, you can use 1, until you start to load objects on mobs,
or insider each other.  <vnum> is the vnum of the object - self explanatory.
<location> is the most complicated part, though simple in the concept.
There are three 'location types':

room       This will make the object load _on the ground_.
inside     This will make the object load _inside the previous reset item_
<location> See HELP LOCATIONS to see a list.  This will make the object
	   load _on the last reset mob_. ***DO NOT USE THIS ANY MORE****
NONE       This should be used in place of location.           

Chance is OPTIONAL, since it's in [ ]'s - if you leave it out it assumes
75% chance of loading.  There are no total object limits; we don't believe
in first come first serve, everyone has a fair shot at getting anything.

Now, the real hard part is realizing how to set up reset numbers.  Generally
put, you don't need to worry about them _unless_ you are loading objects
inside each other, or on mobiles(NPCs.)  When you do this, however, it will
load the object on the reset previous to it.  For example, if reset #1
loads corpse of an adventurer, you can have reset #2 load a small journal,
inside the corpse by typing RESET 2 OBJ 4003 INSIDE 100.  4003 is the
imaginary vnum for the small journal, and the 100 at the end means chance.

The same concept for mobiles; make the object reset the number AFTER
the mob, and the location is the location on the mob, as in HELP LOCATIONS.

0 ALLY ALLIANCE~

>From time to time, it may become necessary to ally one kingdom with
another. For this brief period of time those kingdoms are considered
as one, and can see each other's channels and can do everything
interchangably except auctions. The alliances are created and
broken by admins and will be fairly rare. These will be used
for various purposes.

type alliance or ally to see who is currently allied.

~

0 ALIGNMENT ALIGN KINGDOM KINGDOMS NATION NATIONS SIDE SIDES ALIGNINFO~
There are no good and evil alignments anymore. There are now several
different alignments, one may be considered good, and the other evil,
but as in real life these definitions really are determined by which
side you're on.  Few people view themselves as evil.  The one side
which is universally hated by everyone is the Forsaken, and you can
not join this side when you first choose an alignment, you can only
forsake via a special command.

The main differences between alignments are the same-side pk restrictions,
if you are a member of align 1 or 3 you may same-side PK as much as 
you wish for whatever reason you wish.  Align 1 also suffers from the
affects of an ancient curse and takes a minor amount of damage under
direct sunlight.  Align 2 may not pk members of their own alignment
under any circumstances or for any reason as it has been disabled.  For
this reason newbies are encouraged to choose Align 2.

Aligninfo or aligninfo <align_name> or aligninfo <align_number>
will give you specific information on an alignment.
~

0 ARENA CHALLENGE ACCEPT~

We have an arena where you can practice pkilling without loss of
equipment. You can also bet on the arena, but you must arena
someone who is of your own alignment, or which is allied with your
alignment. You must be at full hit points to challenge someone.

You type

Syntax: Challenge <playername> 

then they type

accept yes or decline to avoid the arena. While you are spelling up
for combat in the arena other people can type 

bet show 

to see who is fighting, and then 

bet <amount> <1 or 2> 

to place a bet.

~

0 AUCTION BID~

We have an auction system that allows you to sell to people of your own
alignment (NOT allies in this case). To start an auction type

auction <item> <amount of copper (at least 100)>.

This will set up the auction and set a starting price which is 
higher then your starting price since the autotransfer costs money.
The buyer pays half, and the seller pays half of the transfer fee
so if you have a low price on an item with a high transfer fee,
you can lose money selling it.


To bid on an item, just type bid <amount (of copper)>.

You can overbid someone by bidding 20 more coins, but people who
constantly bid things up by 20 coins tend to get pkilled by their
own side.

If you wish to halt an auction because a mistake was made,
such as someone bidding 10000 when they meant 1000, 

type auction halt

This must be done before going twice. It is possible to spam
auction/halt on an item..and any time you put an item up for
auction you don't intend to sell it, it can be considered spamming.
If you spam auction, your side might pkill you for being annoying.
Private auctions are part of the "unwritten rules" that make things
easier...please try to respect private auctions as long as the
people engaged in this do not do it too often. However, there
are no rules stopping someone from ruining a private auction.
If you make it a habit of interfering with legitimate private
auctions just to be an ass, your own side will probably pkill you.
~

0 BATTLE BATTLEGROUND~
 The Battleground is a place where you battle against other players to
 win a prize. When a Battleground is announced, you enter yourself by
 entering the command BATTLE. When it starts, you are teleported to an
 area of 20 rooms where you fight until you die, or win. Should you
 die, there will be NO experience points loss and NO items loss. You will
 simply be teleported back to the place you were before typing BATTLE. If
 you win you are teleported to your home town. Bugging a god to run a
 battleground will result in demotion, or loss of experience.  Repeated
 bugging may result in something worse...

 There are up to 30 random battlegrounds, each one is different, in some
 spell affects stick.....

{R}Acid and fire spells do damage items in a BG, so items CAN be lost.{w}
{R}There will be no reimbs of any kind for losses caused from the BG.{w}

~

0 BUTCHER~
This skill can be used to turn a corpse into flanks of edible steak.  Rumors
exist that the most skilled butchers can even turn a giant worm corpse into 
delicious, tender morsels that could be sold at the finest of inns and pubs.

~

0 'SHIELD BLOCK'~
This skill can be used if the user has a shield equipped.  It allows the
user to block attacks with his/her shield, preventing damage from that
attack.
~

0 WARPOINTS WAR POINTS 'WAR POINTS' WARPOINT~

These points are a good indicated of how successful you have been
in the war.  Player kills of opposite alignment add a certain amount 
of warpoints, depending on their level.  If you are one of the top ten 
killers in the lands, then your name will go on the topten list (view 
topten list by typing topten).  As a top killer, you do not receive 
anything special per se, except perhaps the respect and fear of other 
players.  The difference between killpoints and warpoints is that 
warpoints represent player kills, while killpoints include 
difficult mob kills.
~

0 DUAL 'DUAL WIELD'~
This skill allows you to successfully attack using two weapons (one
in each hand).  Without this skill, you will only use your primary 
weapon to attack with.  You cannot use two weapons and a shield.
~

0 TROPHY~
This command shows your best kills, along with the
level they were when you last killed him/her and how many times you have
killed the player.  Playerkills in the same alignment will not show up on
this list, nor will mobs.  If all the slots are filled, the lowest level
character will be checked, and if the current kill is of higher level, the
lowest character on the chart will be overwritten. 

Trophy MOBS will show you what mobs you have killed, and how many times you
have killed each one.

at level 15. Type rating and topten. These two commands give you a 
feeling for who is "winning the game". Rating is a measure (not perfect)
of how powerful characters are. Your rating will probably be around
100-140 right now depending on how well you rolled. If your rating is
much below 100, you have a weak character and should consider rerolling.
If you have never placed LoC before, consider playing a Golem or Troll
race and rolling using choices EBBE. This will get you a decent "tank"
character you can use to explore.

Now that you have seen your equipment, type slist skills,
slist spells, and slist profs. These are the three types of
"things" you can learn to use to go out and kill people in LoC. 
Spells come in all kinds, from healing to offensive to location
and identification. Skills are combat-oriented abilities. Proficiences
are roughly speaking non-combat skills. You will note on the
score command you see at the upper right hand corner 
Profs Slots: [ num/num ]
Skill Slots: [ num/num ]
Spell Slots: [ num/num ]

What the first num represents is the number of that type of ability
you have "learned", and the second number is the maximum number
you can learn. This is an important point. We do not have classes
here, but each race is limited in the number of skills and spells
and profs it can learn. So, if you play a sprite, you can learn
a lot of spells and few skills and you will be weak in hand
to hand combat..but will kick butt with spells. The same thing
applies to Golems being very good at hand to hand combat, and weak
spellcasters. A lot of spells have prerequisites which mean
that you cannot just get the "really good spell" without
learning possibly dozens of spells before it. No character
will have all of the "best" spells/skills/proficiences. 
However, it is possible to make a character that is decent
at a little bit of everything.

Type Help NEWBIEFOUR

0 NEWBIEFOUR NEWBIE4~

There are other things you can do to improve your character. 
One such example is ascension, to find out what this is
type help ascend.  Another way is to find and join guilds.
The guilds are sort of like classes, except you can join several 
of them eventually. Many skills and spells and profs require 
ne or more guilds to learn, and some equipment can only be worn by
certain guilds.  Type slist chameleon for an example. You need to
be a member of ALL of the guilds listed to get that spell.
Each guild has been set up to cost a different amount in order to
get to it, and certain guilds do not get along with each other,
for people of exceptional power exceptions are made however.
Once you are actually at a guildmaster, the guild charges a duty
fee.  To view this fee, type guild cost.  As older players will
tell you you used to be able to buy augments, augments are still
in the game but have been moved to a remort only basis.  To view
help on augments type help augment and then help transform.

If you haven't done it already, type help rules and help pkill.
There are a lot of rules, but the basic idea is work with
those who are of your own alignment, don't be rude, and don't
be a pain to the admins. You should pkill people of other 
alignments as much as possible, and if you have never pkilled
before, you will probably not be too good at it, so stick 
with groups until you get the hang of it.

for a particular spell/skill/prof...but it does not repeat
them so you will notice for some of the more powerful attack
spells, spells listed at the bottom of the zpre tree do not have

This command will allow you to see how much weight you are carrying. 
Weight is very important in this game. If you are over weight you will
find it more difficult to move around the world. If you have excess items

Syntax: Fight or Fight <togglename>

Typing the word fight by itself will show you a list of your behaviors
in combat and ground fighting.  Typing fight followed by an option will
toggle option on/off.  For instance "fight elbow" would toggle whether or
not I use elbows in ground fighting.  Here is a brief description of some
of the normal fight toggles:

POWER:       If on, your attacks will do slightly more damage.  If off, you
	     will be able to attack at a slightly increased speed.
AGGRESSIVE:  If on, your attacks will be more forceful and hit more often.
	     If off, you will occasionally dodge a blow that you might not
	     have if aggressive had been on.
GROUND:      If on, you won't try to resist a fight that may end up on the
	     ground.  If off, you will do everything in your power to make
	     sure the fight doesn't go to the ground. If you try to resist 
             going into a groundfight, you will find it very hard to tackle
             anyone.

Certain people in the world, often weapon smiths or armorers, can
repair damaged weapons and/or armor.  Repair <item> will give you an 
estimate of how much the item will cost to repair.  Some magical or 
powerful items cannot be repaired at all, and some items may cost more 
than others to repair.  If you wish the repairs to be done, type Repair
<item> yes, and the repairer will go ahead and fix up your item.

~ 0 ARMOR ARMORCLASS AC 'ARMOR CLASS'~

Armors like breastplates, helmets and various protective spells can
all be used to lower your "Armor" value.  The more armored you are,
the more damage can be "absorbed" from an attack.  If you are well-
enough armored, many attacks will not even reach your skin, and will
just give you a small bruise.  Armor is not a 100% sure fire way to
stop all attacks, though; often an opponent will be able to find an
opening on even a person with incredible armor and the armor may absorb
little or none of the blow.  Many normal people have trouble handling
heavy armor, and actually fight better in normal clothes.  Don't
underestimate the power of speed and agility!

0 PKILLING PKILL PLAYERKILLING~
This mud is a {R}Pkill mud{w}.  Pkill is encouraged to the highest extent.
It is not illegal to pkill someone of the same alignment, but if you pkill
someone of the same alignment for no reason, expect backlash. If you feel
you have been pkilled for no reason, make some friends and get that person 
back. Remember that squabbles within will hurt your alignment in the great
war, and should be looked down apon. Frequent same alignment pkills are not
recommended, and in severe cases could result in action by the gods. Although
you will normally be warned first, you could be frozen or deleted on the first
offense depending on the situation. All same align pkills will be taken on
a case by case basis, and if provoked we will do nothing.

See Help PKILL2

0 PKILL2~



You should, however pkill members of the opposite alignment. If you have
never played a pkill mud before, or even if you have, expect to die a lot
here. You will notice once in a while that things like +* A Chaotian Orc *+
appear out of nowhere and attack you. Those are the things you should
kill. Probably they will have a few people with them, which means
you should run. To learn to pkill, you will need to go out into groups
and pkill solo players for a bit, just to get the feel for it.
Eventually, you can learn to play well enough to pkill solo...or even
take on groups by yourself (although this is VERY dangerous). Type
pkstat or topten to see how the "war" is going. 


A few tips on pkilling:

1) Have aliases like alias t tackle darkie
alias z kick darkie
alias x bash darkie

Also if you are a caster and say your best spell is spike,
alias 1 bash darkie*c spike
Or, if you may have to attacka  big group make an alias
alias 2 bash 3.darkie

Be sure to watch your hps. Set your wimpy to 1/3 your total hps...
Type nospam. There is so much friggin spam in combat that it is impossible
to sort it all out till you are used to it. Cut down on this by getting
rid of the useless messages in combat by having nospam set on.
Try not to flee unless the wimpy kicks in or the leader starts to say out.
PAY ATTENTTION TO WHO IS WINNING THE BATTLE! If you see like 3 people
on your side dying in quick succession...be ready to run. If you see 
members of the opp align dying...be ready to start chasing. It is
generally better in an even battle (say 5 on 5) to start out causing
damage instead of spam tackling...unless your target is someone who needs
to be tackled. Also, be aware of the power of healing...mass healing
is one of the absolute most powerful spells in the game. If the other
side has a couple of mass healers...that can add up to 600 hps to EACH
person on the other side. Make sure you attack the healers, as well
as the mages. Also there are spells that cause no damage, but which hurt
the victim in other ways, like lethargy, wounding, and paralyze. Try them
out. The most important thing is to learn to watch your hps..and play
your part..mages try to cast and take out other mages or cause dam,
healers rescue and heal and unblind and things...warriors try to
cause damage and pin down others and rescue, thieves try to cause
as much damage as possible.

There are several different alignments in the world. Type aligninfo to
get a list of all the alignments and their specials. In order to stop
huge groups from roaming around the mud killing everything in their
path, and to prevent people who are clueless from getting excessive 
pkill rewards, we have instituted rules on the number of people
of your alignment in the area when someone is pkilled. 

When a person is pkilled by someone of a different alignment, the
number of people of the same alignment (or allied see help alliance or
help ally) as the person who got the killing blow who are within a few 
rooms of where the victim died is counted up.
If this number is greater than 6 (although this number may change)
then several things happen.

1. The victim does not get their number of pdeaths incremented.
2. The victim dies and goes to their portal.
3. The victim's corpse will be EMPTY, and the equipment in it will be
   removed from the game.
4. The pkiller and the people of the same alignment (or allied alignments 
   as the pkiller) get no exp, no trophy, no warpoints, no pkills, no
   equipment. The only thing they get is the removal of a kit of 
   equipment from the game. (So if your goal is to take down someone
   loaded or to remove equipment from the game...this will do it.)

There are two stipulations to this. 

First, the number of people counted up is the number of the same or 
allied alignments as the person who got the blow. So, if you have 5 
alignments in one room with 6 people each... and nobody is allied, 
warpoints are normal then. 

Second, your outpost zones have been designated "homelands." Since
homelands are meant to be raided with large groups, if the victim
dies inside a zone designated as a homeland, the limits on the
number of people are lifted. The experience will still be much worse
for large groups, but the warpoints will be there, and the equipment
will not be destroyed.

{R}The following was the opinion of Lonath:{w}

On another note, do not help the members of the opposite alignment. 
If you want to be friends with them, go talk to them on BambiMUD.
One of the most fun things is to kill someone and take their equipment,
then when they cry about it either go to their outpost and yell at
them that you are saccing it because it sucks too bad, or yell at them
thanking them for the equipment, or even better yell and tell them you
want to give it back to them. When they come for it, kill them again.
Even better, pretend like it was a mistake when a trigger went off,
and then maybe kill them a third time if they are that gullible.
Killing someone more than three times within an hour or so is bad,
that gets into spam killing, so at that point you should return home.
Also, another good thing is to act like you are friendly with the
other side...especially the highlevels, then one day lure them
into a trap so you can kill them and get their equipment.

0 MULTI MULTI-PLAYING MULTIPLAYING MULTI_PLAYING MULTIS~

Multi-playing or multi-players are not allowed period!!! Anyone caught
Multi-playing will be dealt with and that could mean they have all of their
characters deleted. Multi playing includes having more then one character
(regardless of the number of email addresses you have) dropping eq from
char and picking it up with a second character, or asking someone to hold
items for you to name just a few. 

Also, to be more specific, we consider it to be cheating if you know
someone who is at your school, or wherever, and you convince them to make
up a character to perform a specific task for you. Let's suppose for a
moment that your roommate does not play the mud, or may play the mud in
the future, so you convince them to make a character and then that
character holds your oh so special {B}MEGA {R}SWORD {Y}OF {W}INSTANT
{G}DEATH{w}. Even though technically they are a different person, they
have no business holding a great item and are basically a storage
character. Now, it is different if there are two people from one site, and
both have tons of hours of playing time. Then if one character gives a
great item to the other to hold, that is reasonable. Making bullshit
characters up, and using them basically as storage characters is not
permitted here. If you want someone to hold something powerful for you,
you must have them work up that character and have them playing a bit. At
the same time, we do not frown upon more than one person playing from one
site, or even having several people from one site swapping eq or being in
a clan etc... Just no bullshit. Make sure everyone who gets the megabuff
eq is a REAL player who has already been playing, and who does not just
log on conveniently when a certain item is needed. Yes we will be
checking, and yes it is easy to do. Even though there are no limited items
here, we will be keeping track of the {W}POWERFUL{w} items, and if they
are in the hands of some newbie that no one has heard of, we will watch
the newbie, and if it logs and hands eq to certain chars then buh bye. 


And another thing, if there is a locked door with a low pop key, don't
have that person sitting next to you in the computer lab make a newbie
char who goes and logs out behind the door, so that when you log on and
want to play you can "conveniently" open the door for you. This is still
multiplaying as far as we are concerned, and also multiplaying covers any
other sneaky junk you may try to pull by having "someone else" who is not
a real player do something for you to make your life easier. It does not
even matter if that character is controlled by a real, live, different
person. In that case you are breaking the spirit of this rule, if not the
letter and that is good enough reason to enforce the punishments.

0 'Align-Elements' Shard Shards~

Many centuries ago there was a great Wizard that could inscribe a rune
on the forehead of the worthy. This rune would give the adventurer
extraordinary powers based on which rune he/she had gotten. There are
four elemental runes, Air, Fire, Earth, Water..Whichever rune the
adventurer picks, their element rune would increase that elements power.
The rune also has magical powers protecting them against certain
elemental attacks. It is not known where this great Wizard is, nor if
he is still alive, but rumors abound of even greater runes which
inflict damage on those of the opposite align.

0 STORE UNSTORE CSTORE CUNSTORE~

Command STORE <object> can be performed at a bank.  This command is used
to store objects in the bank network (withdrawable at any bank throughout
the lands) for a fee which will be stated.  STORE <object> YES finalizes
the storage.

Command UNSTORE <number> or no arguments, shows a listing and/or gets an
item from storage.  You must be at any of the banks of the world, and
have the money in hand to get back your equipment.

Command CSTORE <object> is just like store, only the action can only be
performed in the clan house.  The stored object goes into a pool of clan
items (like a clan donation), for anyone to withdraw, free.

Command CUNSTORE <number> or no arguments, shows a listing and/or gets an
item from the clan storage.  This is totally free, but it is advisable to
check with clan members before taking all their stuff :)

0 INVESTIGATE INVESTIGATION~
This skill allows you to investigate a corpse and determine both the reason
of death, and who looted the corpse.  With mobs, it is impossible to deter-
mine the reason of death (too easy to track people).

There is a delay on this command.  If you succeed (your make the skill roll),
the reason of death and looters (if any) will be revealed.  If not, you
will simply be unable to determine anything from the investigation.  Finding
that someone looted your corpse against your will/knowledge is against the
rules.  Please report it to Orin, and measures will be taken.

The person whose corpse it is will never show up as a looter.

0 BOAT BOATS~

Boats are vehicles you carry around to let you travel across water.

0 LINKLESS 'BAD LINK' LD~

If you lose your link, you will just sit there out in the world ripe for
anyone and everyone to come along and pkill you. If your link sucks, you
are encouraged to come back later or just hope it does not get you killed. 
There are no reimbs, so there will
 be no reimbs for bad links. Just take heart in the fact that if your link
sucks, then lots of other links suck.

101 RESET1~
This help file will (hopefully) explain you how to make mobs and objects
reset by themselves.  This is usually done after the area is done, but when
you do it is up to you.

Resets are done by number.  This means, if there are 4 total resets in a 
room, they will be numbered 1-4.  Also note that both objects and mobiles
are room-resets.  RESET with no argument will show you the current resets
for the room you are in.  RESET 1 will show you the basic syntax for using
the RESET command, but that is confusing, and the reason this help file 
exists.

The first type of reset (although maybe not in the RESET 1 display) is a
mob reset.  This type of reset will let you automatically load a mob into
the room. 

The syntax is: RESET <number> MOB <vnum> [<chance> <max number>].

Let's take it one at a time.  <number> is the number of the reset, not
how many to load.  This will be more discussed later, and you can usually
just make it 1.  MOB isn't a variable, just put MOB to tell that it is a
mob reset.  <vnum> is the vnum of the mob you want loaded.  <chance> is
the % chance that the mob will load upon reset.  <max number> is how many
of the mob can exist in the world; for example, shopkeepers would be 1, 
so that two identical 'Bob''s don't load in the room.  <chance> and 
<max number> are in [ ]'s which mean they are OPTIONAL(you can leave them
out and it will assume 75% chance, and 100 max number.)

For example, let's say you have a small red bat, vnum 10000.  You would type
RESET 1 MOB 10000 100 7 - if you want it to always load, and 7 max in 
world.

If you want mobs to automatically mount, just set the mounting mob's
riding act3 flag, and put it in the reset list after the mob you want 
it to mount.

Same goes for follower mobs.

101 RESET~
SYNTAX: reset area
	reset room

Useage: To reset the entire area again.
	To reset just the room you are in.

See Also:  {R}RESET1, RESET2{w}
~



101 RESET2~
The second type of reset is an object reset.  These are more complicated
than mobs, but the syntax is similar. 

The syntax is: RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> NONE [chance].

<number>, like mob resets, is the number of the reset, not how many to
load.  For now, you can use 1, until you start to load objects on mobs,
or insider each other.  <vnum> is the vnum of the object - self explanatory.
<location> is the most complicated part, though simple in the concept.
There are three 'location types':

room       This will make the object load _on the ground_.
inside     This will make the object load _inside the previous reset item_
<location> See HELP LOCATIONS to see a list.  This will make the object
	   load _on the last reset mob_. ***DO NOT USE THIS ANY MORE****
NONE       This should be used in place of location.           

Chance is OPTIONAL, since it's in [ ]'s - if you leave it out it assumes
75% chance of loading.  There are no total object limits; we don't believe
in first come first serve, everyone has a fair shot at getting anything.

Now, the real hard part is realizing how to set up reset numbers.  Generally
put, you don't need to worry about them _unless_ you are loading objects
inside each other, or on mobiles(NPCs.)  When you do this, however, it will
load the object on the reset previous to it.  For example, if reset #1
loads corpse of an adventurer, you can have reset #2 load a small journal,
inside the corpse by typing RESET 2 OBJ 4003 INSIDE 100.  4003 is the
imaginary vnum for the small journal, and the 100 at the end means chance.

The same concept for mobiles; make the object reset the number AFTER2
the mob, and the location is the location on the mob, as in HELP LOCATIONS.

ALWAYS PUT AN $N AT THE END OF EVERY!!!! DESCRIPTION OR TITLE WHICH YOU
HAVE PLACED COLOR INTO. If you do not do this, then your title/object will
"bleed" and everyone will think you are an annoying dork for doing this. 
~
0 BLINK~

This is a type of parrying skill used by mages. It requires high int and wis
to use, and it uses 1 mana each time it blocks a hit. It can be configured 
on and off by use of the autoblink command.

{R} This is not a spell in the traditional sense of casting spells.
To use it, type config autoblink and you will automatically attempt to
blink in combat. Do not try to cast blink, because nothing will happen.{w}
~
0 RANGED 'RANGED SPELLS'~

This is the spell that lets you cast spells at range. You must learn
the spell all the way to the max possible percent, or else it will
not work, and it will never improve if you are below the max
possible practice percent. Use of this "spell" is automatic once you
have it practiced high enough.


{R} DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CAST THIS SPELL! It is not a spell in the
traditional sense, but is merely a skill listed as a spell so that
the wussy spellcasters don't have to waste a skill slot.{w}

     Run will get you past players spamming "kill xxxx" and also allow you
     to avoid tintin auto-hunt.

CLIMB: Syntax is CLIMB <up/down> <object name>.  For instance, Climb up tree.

ENTER: Syntax is ENTER <object/thing in room>.  For instance, enter portal.

0 MAP MAPPING~

Mapping is available only to those who are members of the Ranger's guild.

We do not have a map of the new world, and we may just keep it that
way. However, there is a type of overhead mapping which lets you
see the area nearby. Give it a try by typing mapping, or just map to
toggle it. If you get funky looking characters, type {R}noibm{w} and you
will get standard ASCII characters.

There is also a feature called {R}mapspam{w} which redraws your character as
it moves inside of a static map to cut down on bandwidth.
It works ok unless the builder made a mistake or a maze which causes
overlapping rooms.

There is a feature called {R}viewmobs{w} which puts a big M on the screen
wherever mobs are. 

You can also see players (of your own alignment or allied with you)
with the command {R}viewplayers{w}. It was considered letting this
show all players, but that seemed too cheater..even though it is
a lot of fun chasing a red P around with your red X (if you
are not in mapspam mode).

If you need to refresh the map type scan refresh and it will redraw
the overhead map.

If you want an overhead map that "moves" with you sort of like the old
Wizard eye view from Might and Magic, just don't use the mapspam
option. You will probably find viewmobs too annoying to use in most
areas since the whole map will be covered with M's, but if you turn 
it on, scan refresh to get a new view, then turn it off you can get
a nice map of the nearby area and see where the mobs are.

The lands are at war. Take up the struggle of the four great nations
as they vie for dominance over the Lands of Chaos. It was not always like
this. In ages past, the land was vibrant and filled with life...before
the dark days when the Valheru struggled with the Shadows for dominance.
The Targannan and Lawthera retreated into their homelands to await
the eventual outcome of the struggle, but then the Shadow and Valheru
turned upon them. Treachery brought the Targannan to the gates of the
Lawthera keep demanding justice for their slain king, and then
the battle was joined on all sides. The ensuing wars destroyed
most of the neutral and outlying cities in the land. Travellers
today walk through the burned-out shells of once mighty capitals
and ports which now lie rotting, with perhaps a smattering of poor
scavengers and merchants left to pick over the refuse. 

You must choose a which side to serve. Each side will attempt to woo
you with its promises of power and glory during your training days,
but you must choose carefully, for this is a choice for life.

This powerfull channel allows a player to communicate with players of the 
opposite allignment. It encourages pkilling, gloating, and trash talking. 
You must be level 60 to use this channel. Broadcasting your voice to the

points.

~
0 WARRIOR~

The Warriors Guild is an association of men and women who share a common
interest in the art of war.  When you join this guild, you will  by
taught how to fight more ferociously, and you will probably notice an
increase in the damage done on every blow to an opponent.  Your strength
will also improve by one during your membership period.
~
0 THIEF~

This small, shunned group of thieves puts all of its members through a
difficult dagger-dodging seminar.  Not only will you become substantially
better if you already have a background in "dodge", but you will also
gain a point of dexterity.
~

0 TINKER~

The Tinkers Guild is a guild of skilled craftsmen who have come together
to monopolize the business of repair.  By joining the Tinkers Guild, you
will receive great discounts on repair costs, you will be taught to fight
more effectively with hammers and other concussion weapons, and most of
all, you will gain a point of constitution for joining. 
~ 


0 HEALER~

The Healers Guild is an open organization of a cross between a warrior 
and a healer. Tradionally this was true until Healers decided to go 
straight on curing the needs of the many. A Healer can become a half 
warrior half healer but can also go straight to being a healer. Healers 
have always played the role of the crusader. A white knight on his horse 
fighting for the right of god. This is also traditionally true but a few 
stray souls have defected to the unholy side which also fight for evil and 
wish to heal the minions which support evil. Upon joining the Healer's 
guild you recieve a point of wisdom for your allegience.

 ~ 0 ROGUE~

The Guild of Rogues is a shadowy brotherhood of stealthy killers.
When you join this guild, you will be able to backstab and circle
for significantly more damage than before. However, the Rogues
do not get along with very many other guilds, so choosing this path
will restrict you in the use of magic. You will also gain a point of
dexterity when you join this guild.
~
0 WIZARD~

The Wizard's Guild has been set up to use magical power in its most 
destructive forms. Although Wizards will not be able to
heal as well as the members of the Healers Guild, only the members of
the Guild of Wizards can harness the destructive energies of the
higher power attack spells. Members of the Wizard's Guild also gain a
point of intelligence when they join. 
~

0 RANGER~

The Ranger's Guild is the domain of the hardiest hunters of the land.
Members of this guild become world-class trackers, and get training in
the arts of slashing. When you join the Rangers Guild, your
constitution will increase by 1 because of the rigors of the training
period.  
~


0 CONJURER~

The Guild of Conjurers is where you will learn to cast lasting magical 
affects more effectively. When you join this guild, you will notice that
your attack spells are a little more powerful, and your protective spells
will last a little longer, and be a little more powerful. You gain a point 
of intelligence when you join the Guild of Conjurers.
~

0 MYSTIC~
Mystics deal with the arcane, and spirit realm of magic. There are many
spells which require the knowledge of the Mystic's Guild to learn and
cast and are closely guarded secrets which will not be divulged to
outsiders. Ywill notice a slight improvement in the power of your healing
spells.
~

0 NECROMANCER~
Not much is known about the origins of this circle of dark knowledge. Some
say that a few healers of the first age might have discovered the secret of
life and that power drove them mad into the abyss of corruption. Disliked
by many, these people dwell in the realms between life and death. Your
intelligence will be enhanced once you find your way into this circle.
~

0 BATTLEMASTER~
Although the Warrior's Guild teaches people how to fight in general,
the Battlemaster's Guild teaches the more advanced arts of fighting.
Most of the more powerful attack skills require the precise knowledge
and training that only the Battlemaster's Guild can provide. When you
join the Battlemaster's Guild, you will gain a point of strength.
~
0 BARBARIAN2~

Wizards are the Kings and Queens of fighting spells.  They posses the

Necromacers converge with the dead. They can raise beings from dead
carcasses, and order them to do what they want with them. Necromancer's
spells are not quite as devastating as a Sorcerors, but their undead
minions can be tricky, and quite lethal.

0 GUILD GUILDS~

Guilds are organizations of professionals which share common knowledge about
certain trade secrets and lore about the world. Guilds are not the same as
teachers of skills, although some guildmasters undoubtably teach skills.
When you join a guild, you gain certain advantages for joining, but there
is a price. The guilds are not to be confused with clans, which are 
very secretive, tightly knit groups. Guilds are open to people of all
alignments and races, and only require that you accumulate certain fees
before joining. Some guilds are not compatable with other guilds. See
landsofchaos.dune.net for a list of what guilds can coexist.

There are currently twelve guilds in the world:

Warrior, Healer, Rogue, Thief, Rogue, Tinker, Ranger, Conjurer,
Mystic, Battlemaster, Necromancer, and Monk.

In order to join a guild, you must first find the signum for that guild,
these are sold by specific mob's through out the world. After getting the
signum you must get past the guard and locked door so as to be able to give
the signum to the guild guardian, he will then give you passage to the guild
hall.

You must make sure you have the required price of joining. Typing Guild Cost
will show you the requirements. The remort requirements and the level
requirements are not things you lose, merely things you must have already.
When you are actually at a guildmaster, you may type Guild Join, Guild Info,
Guild Status, or Guild Leave. 

Guild Costs
Guild Join (at guildmaster)
Guild Leave (at guildmaster)
Guild Replace (at the guildmaster you want to join - 100 wps and 600 gold)


{R} IF YOU GUILD REPLACE YOU WILL LOSE ALL OF YOUR SKILLS AND SPELLS AND
PROFS!!!!! THIS IS BECAUSE LAMERS REFUSED TO DROP THEIR GUILD GOTTEN
SKILLS WHEN THE COMMAND WAS FIRST IMPLEMENTED!!!! YOU WILL ALSO HAVE
MAPPING TURN OFF IF IT IS ON!!!!!!{w}

Help guildcombo will show you information on the 'classes' we employ.
However, you are welcome to choose whichever guilds you like.

Cadd,
This command is used to add someone to the clan.

Cremove,
This command is used to remove someone from the clan.

0 CLAN CLANS~
Clans are tightly-woven social groups that stick together through thick 
and thin. Joinig a clan has no statistical advantage, but in a pkill world
friends are always good to have. 

As a member of a clan you have access to the following new commands:

Clantalk,
This is just like any other communication channel, except this one only
transmits to your clan only.

Clan,
This command gives you a list of your clan setup.

Clan List 
This command allows you to view a list of  all clans

If you want to start a clan, you must meet the following criteria:

1.  You must have 4 other members on-line who want to join.
2.  You must be level 40 or above, and a frequent player of LoC.
3.  You must not be in another clan.
4.  You must have a good name for the clan.  The definition of 'good
    name' is up to the Admin helping you.  All decisions about decency
    will be backed by the other Admin.
5.  You must have demonstrated leadership, and not be a "problem player."
    This rule is serious.  We will not have clans led by people that will
    abuse their power.
6.  You must have 100 Warpoints, which are not lost when 
    starting the clan.
7.  A Fee of 500 gold coins will be charged to the clan leader to start 
	the clan. This fee pays for the privilage of having a clan, and 
	the clantalk channel and for the starting clanhouse.

*Note* You may {W}NOT{w} add people to your clan with out their
permission.

Each clan can only have a maximum of 15 members. This is not coded so it will
be enforced on a case by case basis. This is to help inscrease the number of
clans, and hopefully encourage clan wars. If a clan is in violation of this 
clause, and gets caught, the clan will be disbanded, the house will remain,
and the members will have to pay for a new clan all over again.

0 ALIAS ALIASES MACRO MACROS~
Syntax: alias
Syntax: alias {<characters>"} {<does-this>}
Syntax: alias <number> deletes the alias.

A '*' character in an alias will be considered as if you pressed enter.
A '%' character will be translated as an argument.  For instance:

Example: alias {pb} {put % in backpack}

from now on, 'pb waterskin' would be expanded to 'put waterskin in backpack'.

Example: alias {5} {sleep}       -will make you sleep after you type: 5  <enter>
Example: alias {rs} {rest}       -will make you rest after you  type: rs <enter>
Example: alias {yum} {get bread*eat bread*smile}
Example: alias {k} {kill}

Aliases are used so you don't have to type so much.  It also enables you
to do multiple tasks such as: backstab, flee, run south. 

-Note: if you give an argument to the alias, it will use it as an argument
       to the last command in the alias.  (i.e., using the 'k'='kill'
       example, 'k bear' will come out as 'kill bear'.
~  


0 CLEAR CLS~
Syntax: clear
Syntax: cls

This command will clear up your screen which can get messy with unwanted
line noise or other breakups of text in display.
~

0 BREAK~
Syntax: Break [dir or doorname]

BREAK will allow a player to try and break a door.  If you look at the
direction you want to break in, it'll tell you how strong the door is.
If the door breaks open, it'll close on reset.  If it's broken, it
is broken for good.  Or at least until the next reboot.
~

0 STEADINESS~

This skill will help you to avoid getting tackled and bashed and
might even help reduce damage from combat hits.
~


0 FLAIL~

Flail is a more powerful form of flurry which you can use only
when you are very hurt. It will remove a little more of your stamina
than the flurry skill does.

Your current strength must be at least 30 for flail to work.

~


0 FLURRY~
Syntax: Flurry

Flurry is a combat skill that allows you to flail about madly in a
wild flurry.  Because of the extreme energies required to go berserk
like this, you will end up losing many stamina points.  So...  if you are 
planning to run after the battle, this is not a good option.  Anyone can 
flurry with or without a weapon.  This skill is natural to everyone; it
does not have to be learned or practiced.
~

0  TEACH PRACTITIONER~

Guildmasters or Practitioners are special mobs.
These mobiles teach you new skills/spells.


When a mob becomes a practitioner, you must assign skills that it
can teach to characters (and characters can practice there too).
The format is TEACH <NUM>, where <NUM> is the skill number (the first
number) from SLOOKUP 'skill_name'.  Okay.. confused?  Here is an
example: Fred the practitioner wants to teach dodge and parry.
After I have type PRACTITIONER in medit, I then type:
slookup dodge
(I see the first number is 80, so I type TEACH 80)
slookup parry
(I see the first number is 84, so I type TEACH 84)
press ENTER to see if the correct skills have been entered, and to
remove a skill, simply type TEACH (number of skill to remove).
Example: I don't want Fred to teach dodge, so I type
TEACH 80 (again, and it says, skill removed.)
...Easy!  This adds a whole new dimension of "seeking out trainers"
and I worked my ass off too so be grateful!!! :)

0 BALANCE CONVERT WITHDRAW DEPOSIT BANK 'BANK COMMANDS'~
Syntax: Balance
Syntax: Convert
Syntax: Deposit  <amount of copper> or ALL
Syntax: Withdraw <amount of copper> or ALL

Note: In withdrawing money (IE using the bank), the bank will keep a small 
surcharge (for keeping your money safe).  All transactions are in copper.
1 silver= 10 copper, 1 gold = 10 silver, etc..

Convert will convert large amounts of coins into smaller, more valuable 
coins.  EXAMPLE: you are carrying 50 gold, and it's weighing you 
down.  Go to a bank, type convert, and they will exchange those 50 
gold for 5 platinum.  No surcharge.

0 KICK 'DOUBLE KICK'~
Syntax: Kick <victim> or in combat, just Kick

This skill allows you to kick an opponent, inflicting extra damage during 
combat.  After you have kicked, you usually are a little off-balance and
it takes 2-3 rounds to recover well enough to cast, flee or perform 
another kick.  The power of your kick depends on your level; at low 
levels kick is next to useless, at high levels it can be invaluable.

It is impossible to kick ghosts or flying opponents for obvious reasons.

Double kick automatically gives you a chance of getting a second kick
right after the first. 

~

0 BLOCK~

This skill block ssome incoming kicks. It is automatic once practiced.
~

0 AWARENESS~

The awareness spell allows you to see sneaking people who enter the room,
and allows you to notice people entering the room while you sleep.
~
0 ACCURACY~

This skill helps you hit a little more often. It is automatic
once practiced.
~


0 BASH SMASH~
Syntax: bash <victim> or in combat, just bash

This skill allows you to attempt to push an opponent backwards forcefully 
and rapidly, causing them to fall to the ground.  If successful, the 
victim will not be able to attack for 1-2 rounds (only defend).

Success of bashing is based on how well you have practiced bash, your 
strength, and the victim's dexterity and dodge ability.  

NOTE: With this skill it is possible that you fall on top of your victim, 
in which case you will begin to ground fight, so IF YOU WANT TO AVOID 
GROUNDFIGHTING AT ALL COSTS, DON'T BASH!!!!

Smash is an upgrade of bash that automatically causes damage
sometimes, and keeps your opponent bashed longer sometimes.

See Also: {R}GROUNDFIGHTING FIGHT{w}
~

0 TACKLE~

This command will allow you to run at an opponent, trying to tackle 
him/her/it and take them to the ground.  If successful, you will go into 
ground fighting mode...  High dexterity helps, but it is still very 
difficult to tackle an opponent even if your dexterity is high.  If you 
fail the tackle, you will be off-balance for the next 3-4 rounds, so if 
you are planning on fleeing soon, it is not wise to tackle.  You may not
tackle with a weapon in hand, or against someone with a weapon for safety
reasons... they could chop you to shreds upon entry, and/or you could
hurt yourself badly tackling with a sword in your hand.

See Also: {R}GROUNDFIGHTING{w}
~

0 GROUNDFIGHT GROUNDFIGHTING 'GROUND FIGHTING'~

It is recommended that you configure the ground fighting option OFF at
low levels.  (Type FIGHT to see your combat options).

occasionally in battle, the fighters will miss a bash and trip, or one 
will tackle another.  The fight will be then taken to the ground.  
Ground-fighting is no-nonsense and fast; close in biting and head butting 
can kill in extremely short amounts of time.  Once you are on the ground, 
you perform on instinct.  Hard helmets make head-butts harder, masks can 
protect against elbows to the face, and many other factors can 
increase/decrease damage taken. 

    If you are fighting multiple opponents, it will become difficult for 
them to find a line of attack (since you are twisted up on the ground with 
your opponent...)  However, if another attacker does find a line of 
attack, he/she/it can slash/pierce/whatever you.  Since you are entangled 
with your opponent, you will not be able to dodge or parry the incoming 
attacks.  Also, a person assisting a ground fighting player/mob without a 
weapon will not punch anymore; he/she/it will now stomp.  Stomps also 
usually do more damage.  In general, it is not recommended that you go to 
the ground with multiple opponents.
~

0 MEDITATE MEDITATION~
Syntax: Meditate

This command allows you to sit down and meditate, allowing the gem in 
your hand to charge at a greatly increased rate.  You will, however, not 
receive the massive bonuses to move and hit points that you might receive 
if you slept or rested.  Typing meditate while already meditating will stop 
you meditating and bring you to your feet.

~

0 EXCHANGE SWAP~
Syntax: Exchange
Syntax: Swap

This command switches items in your primary and secondary hands.  If two
items are held, the positions exchange.  If one item is help, its position
switches between primary and secondary hand. 

~

0 CITIES CITY-UPGRADES CITY-UPGRADE~

No longer allowed.

0 GLANCE~

Syntax: glance <victim>

This command will let you see only the condition of a mob or players.

~
0 SEARCH SEARCHING~
Syntax: search or search <direction>

Based on how well you have practiced the search skill, you might find objects
other players have hidden in the room, or hidden doors' names.

See Also: {R}HIDE{w}
~

0 SPAM NOSPAM~
Syntax: nospam
Syntax: spam

This command is essential in large groups with anything slower than a 14.4k 
modem.  Nospam mode only shows the hits that take place during combat,
and later, will cut down the general spam associated with groups.  
To bring back SPAM mode, type spam.  There are THREE levels of spam.  
FULL, MODERATE and NOSPAM.  Use spam command to toggle between them.
~

0 ANSI COLOR~
Syntax: config ansi 
Syntax: ansi <channel> <color name>
Syntax: ansi <channel> <color index number>

For those of you with terminals which support ANSI Color codes, the 'ANSI'
command can be used to configure ansi for your system.

Here is a list of the channel names (the capitalized column to the right) and
all the color names and their respect index numbers (on left):

00 black           08 dark_grey          17 flashing    SAY

Good players should not loot other good players corpses. If that is the game
you want to play you should play an evil character. If someone loots your corpse
and will not give you back your eq, do not cry to the gods, form a group and get your
eq back!

101 BUILDER-RULES BUILDER_RULES~

As a builder you are expected to not interfere at all with morts. 
This includes, but is not limited to the following things:

You may not converse with morts either over global channels or with tells.

You must keep all global channels: chat and ctalk and ooc OFF! You
 may of course keep the imm channel on.

You may not give anything or take anything from mortals.

You may not go to open areas, and you must not have anything from an 
unopened area appear in an open area by any means at all.

You may not link your area to an open area, place an item on a mob, have the
mob walk through the open room, then unlink the room and have your 
mort kill the mob to get the item.

You may not load cheater mobs for morts to kill for exp. 

You may not give or place any portals of any kind which could take morts
to a room which is hard to get to..even if the portal is from an open
area to another open area.

Do not wander around other peoples areas looking for the secrets and resets
and eq and mobs and soforth.

We can and do log oload and mload. If you spend too much time dicking 
around with other people's crap you will be deleted.

Do not make cheater eq or mobs, even if they are just for a 
moment..or to "test" something. 

Don't attack the other builders. Ever. We do not want to see 
anyone on topten.


In fact, unless you are in your own area in oedit medit or redit...and only
working on your own area to make legitimate items, you are
 probably breaking a rule.

expect are stated after each rule.  However, we do reserve the right
to modify penalties as we see fit based upon the circumstances.

Severe penalties will not be handed out until two Imms have discussed
the matter and agreed upon the outcome. There may be a temporary
freeze until another Imm can be consulted.

Rule: General cheating, such as bug abuse, playing multiple characters,
      or attempting to log on to other players characters will result
      in immediate deletion with no discussion.  If you feel the need to
      reroll and argue with the immortals expect a siteban.

Rule: Chat, Tell and Pray are no longer an acceptable method to contact the 
      immortals regarding gameplay issues.  If you have a suggestion on
      changing the mud then post a note to immortal. It will be read and
      carefully considered by the immortals, but you may not get an answer
      since that just leads to never ending debates. We make the best decisions
      we can based upon what is best for the mud as a WHOLE.

      Pray is for emergancy use ONLY, such as reporting cheating.
      Chat and Tells are for social chatting with the immortals only.  Expect
      several warnings followed by silencing.

Rule: Chats and notes such as 'This mud sucks' 'That is stupid' and 
      'The imms here are gay' are not accepeted very well here. We
      spent and are spending a great deal of time and money on this mud, we
      do so to provide an enjoyable experience for everyone.  If you are not
      enjoying yourself, then leave. You will not be allowed to ruin the game
      for other people. You will be warned, then silenced and then frozen.
      The progression of penalties will happen VERY quickly.  So if you get a
      heads up from an immortal that your comments are out of line you need to
      be VERY careful what you type before you hit the enter key again.
      Chat trash talk is over, as of now. This includes vulgar or racial comments.
      A word to the wise, what you consider vulgar or racial does not matter, it
      is what the immortals consider vulgar or racial.  Dont give the admins crap,
      our decisions are final.  If you get frozen or silenced and reroll to argue
      you will be deleted for multiplay/aurguing.

Rule: Scripting is not allowed.  Triggers and speedwalks are allowed.  Yes
      a group of triggers can be put together to make a script and it will
      be considered a script for the purposes of this rule.  So, scripting
      XP or script practicing skills and spells will be violations, for
      example.  A trigger to bash enemy will not.  Loss of levels and presets
      are to be expected if you script XP or spells.

Rule: Do not spam kill one person. Sometimes people give up. Leave. You will
      loose most if not all of your warpoints, we are not going to sit
      here and do math figuring out how many warpoints you got from spam
      killing and just take those away. We have better things to do with our
      time than clean up your mess.  If you do it repeatedly you will be
      deleted.

Rule: Do not spam die to the members of the opposite alignment.  This will
      result in deletion.

Rule: Same side killing. The mud is now set up so that only foresaken and
      evil can attack their own players.  However, this is not a license
      to harrass other players.  If you have a dispute that you feel you
      need to settle via a same side kill that is your choice.  But repeated
      killing, attacking or spamming a player of the same alignment will
      fall under player harrasment and the immortals will step in. Since
      this is always a difficult area to cover you will be warned to cease
      the harrasement before any stronger measures are taken.

      In any case you may not attack a player of the same align unless they
      have a red P-flag or have at least one remort. If you use a game bug
      to force them into a P-flag you will be considered a cheater and 
      dealt with acording to the bug abuse rules at the begining of this
      document.

      If you do not have the P-flag and you are attacked and want to 
      report it, write a note or email to the imms. You must not have
      the P-flag at the time the imms deal with the person you are
      accusing. You must report it fairly promptly, say within a day
      or two. There are no "I want to report it but be nice to them"
      options. If you report it, and they did it, they get punished.
      If you "take it back", you get punished so you had better be
      sure you want to report this.

      If you play games with the P-flag and use it to screw people 
      on your own side, because they cannot attack you, you will be given
      the P-flag.


Rule: Do not let anyone know your password and don't pick stupid 
      passwords like psipsi or wrapper. If you have a password that 
      some of your friends know, change it. The only person who may 
      log in a character is the person who originally made it. 
      Do not roll characters for other people. Do not log in your
      friends' characters. 
 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The guidelines below will help you stay on our good side, or will help you
enjoy the mud more:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guideline: No reimbursements.  If we really mess up and we are planning to
           give reimb's, we will post it on the message of the day (help
           MOTD, or shown automatically when you enter the game). If there is 
           no notice in the MOTD consider yourself out of luck. Do not even 
           think of begging.

Guideline: Have fun.  On a pkill mud there always has to be a winner and a
           loser; the winner feels great, the loser feels like crap.  Just
           remember that although you may be the loser one day, you may be
           the victor the next.

Guideline: Don't be annoying; it's a privilege to play, not your right.  If
           you swear, spam, or try to use any bugs to your
           advantage, you could get on an admin's bad side (not good).

Guideline: Don't ask admin to reveal secrets, or even common questions about
           the game (like... 'am I close to the cave?').  Admin will only
           answer questions you have about general game play, etc.

Guideline: Don't suggest ideas to admin online.  The best thing to do is to
           email loc@landsofchaos.com, email a specific admin, (see help Flatline,
           Structure, Tonik) or leave a note on the board in town to 'admin', 'gods', 
           or immortal.

Guideline: Try to help out your side when they need it. If someone on 
           your side is getting pkilled, and asks for help, try to 
           help them out. Someday your butt will be on the line and 
           you will need the help.

Guideline: If you enter a mob and see a hurt mob, it is techinically not
           killstealing to attack and kill it. However, you will anger
           whoever is attacking it. If you drop equipment on the ground,
           it is no longer yours, however picking up equipment from the
           ground is a bad idea, since people will generally try to
           hunt you down.

 
Guideline: Don't hog eq. When in groups decide on some way of splitting the
           eq you get. Generally the "whoever loots gets it" and then making
           sure everyone gets a piece of eq before anyone gets a second 
           piece of eq method works. If you hog eq or refuse
           to share, other people may consider looting your corpse to get
           the eq, or they may refuse to help you out when you need it.

Guideline: Help out the newbies on your side. Nothing ruins a mud more than
           experienced players who refuse to help out the newbies. Yes, they
           ask a lot of stupid questions, and they ask the same questions
           over and over, but eventually they will get it. Just make a 
           little effort to help them and they will be useful someday
           when you are in a jam. 

 

~

0 IGNORE~

Format: Ignore <annoying person's name here>

Ignore with no argument will show you who you are currently ignoring.  
You may ignore up to 10 people, and when ignored, no says, gossips, 
tells, replies, or anything will be seen from them.  This can be a life 
saver with poor-sport newbies who get on to annoy you because you killed 
their character :)  ALWAYS report spamming characters through a note,
telling at what time they spammed you, and exactly what happened.  Often
spammers will be immediately site banned. 
{W}NOTE{w}
Ignoring an admin is not an option.

~

0 TRAPSET TRAPS TRAP~

You use the trapset command to set traps in rooms..but you must be
holding a trap to do this. People more attuned to the outdoors or
mechanical things, or just general sneakiness help to set traps
properly.

trapset by itself will put a trap in the room.
trapset <direction> traps a door.
trapset <container> traps a chest or container.

~

0 DETRAP~

0 LAMER~

If you act like a lamer, trying to avoid a rule by looking for some loophole,
or if you are in general a complete asshole yo your side because you can
get away with it due to your large levels or clan, you will be awarded
the lamer flag. You won't like this, so try not to be an asshole.

See Also: {R}PRACTICE{w}
~


0 DEATH~
Character death is not permanent.  However, it is not a good thing...

1) Any spells which were affecting you are removed.
2) You lose experience points for dying.  When you die, the experience
   points you lose are based on your total exp points.
3) You will be transported back to a location by your main city.
4) If you were killed by a mob, you will lose 1 percent skill level from a 
   random 20 percent of your known skills.  

Some myths/differences from other muds:

  1.  You can never lose a level from dying at Lands of Chaos.
  2.  Don't count on always getting your corpse back.

Please NOTE:  You can die if you don't eat or drink, and from freezing!
~



0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP EXP LEVELS~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a varying
amount of experience points for each level of experience.  To find out how
much you need for the next level, use the 'score' command. 

You gain experience every time you hit a mob or player and do damage, 
when you cast an offensive spell that damages a player or mob, and when 
you kill a monster or are part of a group that kills a monster.

You lose a lot of experience by dying, and also breaking a rule, which
can result in demotion (aka experience or level loss).

Experience awarded by mobs varies depending on how many have been killed, 
their level, their extra bonuses, etc.  Help GBONUS for group experience 
division.  

~
0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.

Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down
Syntax: climb [up/down] <object>
Syntax: run <direction> [count]
Syntax: enter <object>

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.

CLIMB is used to climb objects that are climbable.  Example: climb up tree.


RUN will move you in a direction until you can't move in that direction
no more.  Or you can give a count of how many spaces to move.  Running
will take more movements off and prevent you from doing anything while
running.

ENTERing objects will allow you into some special places.
~

0 LIGHT EXTINGUISH~
Syntax: light      <light object>
Syntax: extinguish <light object>

Lighting a light-able object can only be done with a tinderbox tool.
Extinguishing a light-able objects puts out the light on demand.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for MAGIC, and also please read HELP MANA.

{R}When you cast offensive spells in certain terrain types, or in certain
types of weather, the damage is increased. You will have to figure out
which terrain and weather affects which spells.{w}

Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~

0 CRITICAL 'CRITICAL HIT'~

This skill gives a thief/assassin with hand speed who is wielding a 
piercing weapon with a dex of 30 or more a chance at causing
a lot more damage with a regular hit or a backstab or circle.

~

0 BACKSTAB BS DISARM KILL~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kill     <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used if you have learned the backstab skill.  BS is a
synonym for BACKSTAB.

DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.

In order to BACKSTAB or DISARM successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.
~

0 SCAN~

Similar to 'look' but shows you all possible directions not just the one.

See Also: {R}LOOK{w}
~

0 PRAY~
Syntax: pray <message you want to say to the Gods>
~

0 FLEE ASSIST RESCUE GUARD~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue <character>
Syntax: assist <character>
Syntax: guard <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to FLEE from time to time.  

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.

You may ASSIST someone at any time.  You will begin to help fighting.


You may GUARD another player and this will essentially cause you to
attempt to rescue them each combat round. It is dependent on how well you
have the guard skill learned, and how many people are fighting you.

~

0 EXAMINE LOOK~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>
Syntax: examine <gem>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.
When you see enemies, you will see different descriptions depending on
how powerful they are.  Here is a list of the ranks:

0 mort    : nothing
1-3 mort  : young
4-6 mort  : elder
7-9 mort  : Prince/Princess
10 mort   : King/Queen

This affects scan as well.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.

Examining GEMS will show you the mana left available to use.

Use: look <direction>      shows you what mobs are in a specific direction
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~

0 GTELL ; SAY LISTEN REPLY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: reply <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

0 NOTE NOTES~
Syntax: note list
Syntax: note write
Syntax: note read    <number>
Syntax: note read    all
Syntax: note subject <string>
Syntax: note to      <to-list>
Syntax: note clear
Syntax: note send
Syntax: note show
Syntax: note post
Syntax: note remove  <number>

NOTE LIST lists notes which you can read.  NOTE READ reads one or all notes.

NOTE WRITE will start the online text editor so you can enter a note easier
than using note +.

NOTE SUBJECT sets the subject line of a new note.  NOTE TO sets the list of
recipients.  The recipient ALL means all players, and the recipient IMMORTAL
means all immortals.  Use NOTE + to write message lines onto the note, one line
at a time.  NOTE SHOW shows your note in progress; NOTE CLEAR starts over.

NOTE POST or NOTE SEND posts your note for reading.  Posting is not automatic.

NOTE REMOVE removes the entire note if you are the sender, or just removes you
from the to-list if you are a recipient.

Although the above looks confusing it is fairly simple to write a note.
Here is a short tutorial.
1) Find a board. Most can be found in towns or in clans.
2) Decide who you want to write a note to. I want to send a note to fred
so I will type {W}note to fred{w}
3) Add a subject line to your note. I want to tell palio that I like the
mud here. so I would type {W}note subject Great mud!{w}
4) Write the note. Type {W}note write{w}. This will take you into an
editor. {W}.h{w} will get you a help list. Some other common commands you
will need are {W}.c{w} clears all texts {W}.f{w} formates the text {W}@{w}
will end the message.
5) Once done I want to post the note to the board. I would type {W}note post{w}
Your note is now posted and can be read by palio.

{R}NOTE{w}
Notes posted by immortals can be read anywhere in the game. Its a good
idea to type note each and every time you log in to see if there is any
new notes for you. Notes posted by players MUST be read on the board it

0 WARMTH~

Your armor has a certain "warmth" value associated with it.
The more warmth you have, the warmer you are when it's cold
out and the hotter you are when it's hot out. Cold and warm now
cause a LOT more damage at the extreme ranges and certain
fire and ice spells will make you hotter or colder for a few
minutes...so casting fireball on someone in a desert is almost
like casting wounding on them for a few hours.

~

0 NEWSOCIALS NEWSOCIAL~

It is possible to add new socials into the game, but it is easier
to have you all make them up and send them in, since there are
several things which need to be done. Here is an example of a 
social from the socials file:


SocialName  nog<tilde>
CharNoArg   You nog.<tilde>
OtherNoArg  $n nogs.<tilde>
CharFound   You nog at $N.<tilde>
OtherFound  $n nogs at $N.<tilde>
VictFound   $n nogs at you in agreement.<tilde>
CharNFound  Nog your head off -- they aren't here.<tilde>
CharSelf    You attempt to nog yourself.<tilde>
OtherSelf   $n nogs quietly to $mself.  What a sicko.<tilde>

Here is a blank social you can use to construct them easier:


SocialName 
CharNoArg  
OtherNoArg 
CharFound   
OtherFound  
VictFound   
CharNFound  
CharSelf    
OtherSelf   

When you make these up, first choose a command to use, and first
check to see if it is used already ;).
Make sure you put a tilde at the end of the line...we cannot put
that in the help file since the help file uses tildes for other
things.

The CharNoArg refers to what happens if you do nog instead of 
nog Kizmet or something like that. It is what YOU see.

OtherNoArg is what everyone else sees if you do a social without 
a target of the social.

CharFound is what happens if you attempt to inflict the social
on some unsuspecting person and they are standing there...it is
what YOU see in that case. Note that $n refers to a place where
YOUR name will be put in, and $N refers to the name of the target.

OtherFound is where you put the message that everyone else sees
when the person you are doing the social to is in the room.

VictFound is what the target of a social sees when someone socials
them.

CharNFound is what you see when you attempt to use a social on 
another player and they are not in the room.

CharSelf is what you see if you social yourself.

OtherSelf is what the other people in the room see if you attempt 
to social yourself.


If there are any lines you do not wish to fill in, such as saying
you don't want the social to be used on other people, then fill
in all of those lines with

CharFound none<tilde>

etc. The word none and then the tilde will make it so nothing happens
in that case.


So, if you want to make a social just copy the list of lines below the
lines with all the nogs in them, and put in the sentences you
want. Please keep these things to one line, and remember to put a
tilde at the end of each line, not the actual word <tilde>. Then you
can submit them to loc@erie.wizvax.net, or I think it will work if
they are put into a note too (but make sure the tildes are in there).
Please try to keep it from getting to sick. Believe it or not we DO
have some standards here, and gross or sick socials will not be put
in.

Also, besides the tildes there are no other special characters that
you need to remember or other words to put in.

0 WHO~

The anonymous command will toggle this feature on/off.

you after a successful circle.

be wielding a dagger in one hand, and holding flash powder in the other.
Then type "flash" once you are already engaged and you will attempt

0 MANA~
Although each character has a certain amount of natural mana, more powerful
spells, and greater mana amounts can be achieved through the use
of GEMS.  Gems add mana, increase mana regeneration rates, and allow you
to cast more powerful spells.  Natural mana regenerates VERY slowly.

You cannot cast a spell like fireball with an earthen gem...
there are four types of gems and magic types: Earth, Air, Water, and
Fire.  Experiment around to see what spells use which.

Type MANA to see your current mana stats.

~
0 GEMS~

107 SEDIT SEDIT_FLAGS~

SEDIT means spell edit. To edit a spell either type sedit create
<name>, or sedit <name>. Sometimes you will have more than one spell
with the same first word, like heal light, heal serious etc...and in
this case you will need to type sedit 'heal light' to make sure you
are getting the right spell. Inside of sedit there are several things
to set. First, there is the spell mana and level, and the casting time
(10 time = 1 combat round). Then there are the mint and mwis which set
the minimal int and wis you need to prac it fully. There are also the
problems of setting the correct mana to cast the spell. Just type all,
fire, earth, water, air or any combination of those to set the allowed
mana types. Then be sure to set whether the spell is offensive
defensive or self. You also must set the prereqs by typing, for
example: pre1 Refresh or Pre2 Shocking Grasp.  Then you must set the
location where the spell damages if it affects something besides just
hps.

To set the amount of damage the spell does to hps type damg <formula>
and look at the chart at the end of this help file to get the things
you can put into the formula.  It will tell you all the things you can
set to make a spell damage formula. Then if you want the spell to
affect something besides hp, such as temporarily lowering or raising a
stat, you jsut tpye in that stat lke dam or moves or hp or str. Then
it will appear above the damg thing that has the formula. Then you
want to type duration <formula>, which tells how long you want the
spell to affect that person. Then you want to type in modifier
<formula> which tells how much the spell will affect the person. Then,
if you want to blind the person or poison the person or make them
invisible, type in thsoe flags just as you would for a mob flag. So
for example, the invisibility spell would need to have invis typed in
for the modifier.

If you want to make a spell that does something different, look at the
chart below to get the other allowable flags. Do not forget to set
adds_moves for refresh spells and heals_dam for healing spells. Also
be careful about the all_in_room and the only_not_group flags, to make
sure those area spell hit only the people they are supposed to.

NOT_SELF     - This spell cannot be cast on yourself, and it will not

101 SPEC_HELP SPEC-PROCS SPEC_PROCS MOB_PROCS~

To set a mob that casts defined spells, or that flurries/tackles/kicks 
more than "spec_warrior" does, you must perform the following in MEDIT.

casts <spellname> - This sets a spell for the mob to cast.  A mob may cast
		    up to 10 unique spells.  To remove a spell from the list,
		    simply type casts <spellname> again, and <spellname>
		    will be removed.  Defensive or target_self spells, the
		    mob will cast on him/herself.  Offensive spells, the
		    mob will use the name of the character he/she is 
		    currently fighting.  Mobs are not delayed by spells,
		    and have unlimited mana.  Mobs will not cast a spell
		    that is higher level than the mob itself.  See
		    cast_p below for more info.

kicks    - Toggles whether or not the mob will kick during battle.  Since
	   mobs are not delayed by kick, please see warrior_p, below.
flurries - Toggles whether or not the mob will flurry during battle.  Since
	   mobs are not delayed by flurry, please see warrior_p, below. 
	   A mob with less than 40 movement will not flurry.
tackles  - Toggles whether or not the mob will tackle during battle.  Since
	   mobs are not delayed by tackle, please see warrior_p, below.

warrior_p <#> - This sets at what percent the mob performs a warrior command.
		100% would mean the mob would perform his warrior command(s)
		every round... it's obvious that this should be set low.
cast_p <#>    - This sets at what percent the mob casts a spell.  100% would
		mean the mob casts a spell EVERY combat round.  It's obvious
		that this should be set low.

NOTE: TO VIEW THIS INFO, YOU MUST TYPE "mindex <vnum>".  This info does NOT
appear in the medit window.  (Same with skills taught).

Lists are special objects that do not load.  When a list object is sent to
the internal procedure create_object(), the long description of the object
is scanned through and a vnum from the list is selected at random.  the
list object itself is only loaded when the vnum on value0 is not correctly
set to the number of vnums in the list.

read CREATION-RULES for the rules on creating lists PLEASE

example:
obj->name        =           "list bread"
obj->short_descr =           "a list of breads"
obj->long        =           "30 32 123 43 65 93"     (assuming objects exist)

most powerful warriors are capable of actually casting off their
vows and joining this "alignment."

set of guilds which give him a unique ability to fight with his bare
hands.  Monks learn a brief set of defensive and healing spells which
come from his spiritual training.  Strength, Dexterity and Wisdom are
all equally important to a monk's success.
It is rumored that a monk can use alignment with the various elements
to unleash hidden powers in his fighting.  Joining this guild will
reward you with improved dexterity.
~

0 'Warlock' ~
The warlock is a cross between a warrior and a Wizard.  They have
ability in both fields, yet not as strong as one who chose one of those
professions.  Strength and Intelligence are the most important for
success.
~

0 'Unarmed Combat' ~
This skill measures a monk's ability to fight with his bare hands and
feet.  The higher it goes, the greater number of hits you will get in
melee and the more damage you will do in general.
~

0 'Translucence' ~
This spell causes the monk to become more lucid and difficult to strike.
~

0 'Buddhas Palm' ~
This skill allows you to focus all of your energy into one potentially 
deadly blow.  Be careful, however -- it can drain you.  
Use the command "palm" to invoke this command.
~

0 Stance Stances ~
A monk can utilize different fighting stances to achieve different 
effects in battle.  All monks start in the basic stance (no effect).

An unascended monk can use these stances:
Viper    : chance of more hits, less dodge/evade/armor
Mantis   : more dodge/evade/armor, less hits/damage
Wolf     : more damage, less dodge/evade/armor

An ascended monk can use these improved stances also:
Tiger    : chance of more hits, less dodge/evade/armor
Mongoose : more dodge/evade/armor, less hits/damage
Bear     : more damage, less dodge/evade/armor

Also, if certain criteria are met an ascended monk can use these:
Dragon   : best offensive stance
Crane    : best defensive stance

Use the command "stance" to see your stance or to change it.
~

0 'Nerve Strike' ~
This skill allows you to make a quick strike at a pressure point of 
your opponent.  It can do serious damage to anyone caught napping.
~

0 'Evade' ~
This monk ability uses all of your primary attributes and speed to 
evade your opponents attack in melee combat.
~

0 'Showloot' ~
This command will show your inventory to anyone of the same alignment 
in the room.  It has a small lag, and if anyone spams it just ignore 
them.  It is for eq splits.
~

0 'Guildeq' ~
This is a new feature added. Certain equipment is flagged for certain guilds.
For example, you have a rare dagger, its thief only, a person with the Thief's Guild
can only wear this item. You can tell if it is a guild specific item by looking at it.

0 'STONE-GIANT' 'STONE-GIANTS'~


Stone giants are lean, but muscular. Their hard, hairless flesh is smooth and gray, making it easy for them 
to blend in with their mountainous surroundings. Their gaunt facial features and deep, sunken black eyes make 
them seem perpetually grim. The typical stone giant is 18' tall and weighs 9,000 pounds because of its dense 
flesh. Females are a little shorter and lighter. Stone giants prefer to dwell in deep caves high on rocky, 
storm-swept mountains. They normally live in the company of their relatives, though such a clans usually 
include no more than 10 giants. Clans of giants do locate their lairs near each other, however, for a sense 
of community and protection. A mountain range commonly has 2-8 clans lairing there. Stone giants are crude 
artists, painting scenes of their lives on the walls of their lairs and on tanned hide scrolls. Some giants 
are fond of music and play stone flutes and drums. Others make simple jewelry, fashioning painted stone beads 
into necklaces. 

Due to their hard, hairless flesh, Stone-Giants gain the natural ability of Hardened Skin.
~

0 'CENTAUR' ~

Centaurs, were said to be the offpsring of Ixion, son of Ares, and a cloud. These strange creatures had the 
head arms and chest of a man but the legs and lower half of a horse. In later myths and stories they somtimes 
had horns, wings or both. These Man-Horse beasts lived in Thessaly, fed on meat and drunken followers of Dionysus, 
except for Cheiron who was the tutor of several heroes.

Due to their love to nature and being one with the earth, Centaurs gain the ability of Mind-Power.

0 'CAPTURE'~

Capture is a new feature in LoC. There are designated battle areas. Sapentenia 
and the Castle of Yur are the only two capture areas. Once you raid the city, 
and type "capture" at the throne room, that entire outpost becomes yours. The 
guards now pledge their allegance to your alignment. By typing "align", you will 
get a specific bonus to your alignment, whatever bonus that OP gives you. Your entire
align will have this bonus until the other alignment can capture it.
~

110 'IMMCAPTURE'~

cvnuml - will set the vnum that you want the area to be the lower number
cvnumh - will set the vnum for the area you want to be, the higher number

For example cvnuml 50000 and cvnumh 50500 will set the areas from 50000-5500
as a capture are, so when they type capture, it will change all the mobs in
those vnum lists.

cbonusstr s or i or w or d or c

Will set what attributed they get when they capture s = strength etc.

redit then type throneroom will set the room as a capturable area.
